comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Am no fan of Manjrekar, but I don't think  BCCI should be the one contracting the commentators. Should be like other countries where the channels are the one hiring the commentators."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"""Manjrekar was not present in Dharamsala during the first ODI between India and South Africa, which was washed out without a ball being bowled on Thursday. Other BCCI panel commentators Sunil Gavaskar, L Sivaramakrishnan, and Murali Kartik were, however, present, reported the Mumbai Mirror.""



This is just pure speculation at this point based on his absense for the first ODI. On the same note , Harsha Bhogle was not present as well for that match."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Honestly, the entire commentary panel needs a revamp, like after-Benaud Channel 9 which was also terrible. Get genuine analysts rather than giving contracts simply because they were a former cricketer."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,Good riddance. Though the current panel is not amazing either. Former cricketers don't necessarily make good commentators. Just look at Sehwag. Makes my ears bleed every time I hear his bullshit.
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,Well we do need to add some quality commentators like bishop isa Nasser Ponting Nicholas and Bumble. The current commentary team sucks even without Manjrekar.

comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"They finally get rid of him, only for the IPL potentially getting cancelled and India not playing another match for a while. COVID-19 Is a cruel mistress. 😡"

Probably gonna stay at home and kill us with his unnecessary commentry on sofa whenever Rohit bhaiya hits a six. You idiots don't you understand how hard it is to be jobless at that age. He was just teaching you lots few nuances of cricket but no BCCI had to take it way. I just hope ESPNcricinfo still have him :D
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"As much as we are happy about this, I hope this action is not in retaliation for his tweet on jan 7 about india loving its heroes no matter their religion.

Sack him for his unprofessional behavior with harsha, I am cool."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Could it be related to his tweet supporting Mumbai protests against violence against Delhi students? Jay Shah probably got a call from daddy.

comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"This was the right decision imo, he made me cringe so much that I started switching channels whenever he was on.

He has enough experience as a cricketer and a commentator, should easily get another coaching or cricket related gig with his resume.  So not gonna feel sad about his misfortune being a positive news. As if he hasn't earned quite a bit already."

impotent saltiness for the win"
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,Great news but I dont get how BCCI would decide this. Surely fans can dress between the lines and see how this is not a good thing.

Manjrekar's commentary isn't something I always agree with but at least he has the guts to say stuff others won't.

And that whole ""bits and pieces"" comment on Jadeja was hyped beyond reason because Jadeja was waaaay too precious (and probably ignorant that bits andnpieces is perfectly acceptable cricketing terminology and not derogatory)."

comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"They actually had a sort of an argument before Ganguly became President. This was during the ""Conflict of Interest"" episode in a BCCI meeting.

Ganguly was of the view that based on some situations, some people can have multiple titles. While Manjrekar said that they should only have one at a time. 


Not saying there is a correlation. Just stating facts."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,Because there two sets of commentators. Few selected by their respective cricket boards and few selected by the broadcasters.. Sanjay belonged to the former
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Nope, it's not that, he genuinely sucked at this job, was very biased, arrogant towards Harsha, and to top that he has been forever boring."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"At the end of the day people only care about what affects them. Hopefully removal of Sanjay Manjrekar might bring some much needed good commentary in indian cricket matches. Its not as if Sanjay Manjrekar is so destitute that this loss of a commentary box job is gonna make him homeless. 

Moreover, its not about what Sanjay Manjrekar says, its about how he says it - he's just a plain bad commentator that somehow reduces a great moment in the match to an okay one, i.e. Shami taking his hattrick in cwc19.

&#x200B;

> Amazing how people on here are celebrating a guy losing his job for no really good reason other than he must have angered someone with power. 

What..? Sanjay Manjrekar was a bad commentator, he got removed, hence some people are treating it as good news. Who is this angered person in power in question."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Exactly this...the others (laxman, kartik and now even Gavaskar) are incredibly bland, boring and speak only in platitudes."

comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Two months with very few matches hosted in India. And Manjrekar probably had a contract till end of this financial year.

Btw, Harsha wasn't more direct than Manjrekar's tweet. Harsha's post required people to read, this does not."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"There is nothing contrarian about what I said. While he was wrong in the argument he had on air with Harsha, he is one of the few commentators who voices his opinion instead of just kowtowing to the BCCI all the time. If he was dropped for being rude to Harsha, I have no problem with that. But I am sure this has more to do with some bruised egos of the players he criticised."

comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"For you, he genuinely sucked at his job. For me, Harsha genuinely sucks at his job. The point is, these are all opinions. Has he been sacked for being below par? If so what was the criteria used to judge him? How did his fellow commentators score on the same criteria? These are the questions to ask if you believe there was some objective basis to his sacking. Otherwise the likely explanation is he got sacked because someone got offended, which is not how it should be done."

comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Nope, to me he's weird and annoying af. Half the time I'm watching a game he's talking about some irrelevant bs. People seem to like him for his quirks, but I find those quirks annoying."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Honestly sometimes the commentary is so bad, listening to it will unsync what's happening with the game.

Commentators taking about cooking, foods, firecrackers for longer time than the actual cricket. I hope more bad commentators follow."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"> Two months with very few matches hosted in India.

And how does that matter when Sanju was pretty much the lead Indian commentator in the NZ series?

> Harsha's post required people to read, this does not.

And Harsha's post was much more scathing and critical. If your conspiracy theory held any value then Harsha would have been fired before Sanju Manju."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Tbh he was not content with just criticising, he was belittling the player. A genuine international all-rounder is bound to feel humiliated if he is called just a bits and pieces cricketer. But I have heard other commentators, especially old-timers say worse, Geoffrey Boycott in one innings repeatedly called Gambhir a rubbish player before and after his dismissal during the 2014 test  series."

Auto-capitalization on phone."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Another example is how Harsha was sort of shadow banned from Star for a while(1 year?) after the ""Nothing to add"" incident. He used to be there for Sony covered tours but not in the series which were covered by Star. Sure it's usually ""either Sony or Star"" arrangement, but it was obvious as to why Harsha suddenly just vanished from Star for a while despite being the best Indian commentator."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"BCCI produces the telecast themselves. Sometimes STAR has additional teams tehere, but the world feed and the majority of the production is done by the BCCI themselves. All commentators during the game in the English language feed are hired directly by the BCCI."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Manjrekar is paid to give his professional opinion. Being a 'Bits and pieces' player is the reason Jadeja got dropped from the ODI and T20 teams 3 years back. On current form, he is probably close to a genuine allrounder, but Manjrekar has the right to his professional opinion.  

I don't understand why our cricketers take criticism to heart every time. They are professionals who are in the public eye and are bound to get criticised. But it is for that ability to perform under such intense scrutiny that they get rewarded with multi million dollar contracts. It just is not right to get someone fired because you don't like their opinion."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Joffrey Boycott? To be fair, Boycott is an old-fashioned type and an expert of English conditions. He was calling out lazy batting by Gambhir trying to leave the ball late. Don't think he called Gambhir a rubbish batsman though."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"it was in reference to your comment that he genuinely sucked at his job, in other words passing off your opinion as fact"
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"True, that was completely out of line. I hope he got pulled up for it. I consider sacking excessive though"
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Yeah, I'm one of the few on this sub who doesn't particularly care for Harsha as a commentator. Maybe I'm biased because of his twitter feed, which is one long stream of inanities without ever making an insightful point."
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,I completely agree with the OP. I've never seen someone speak so much with so little substance as Harsha. He talks like a motivational speaker in a conference. Manjrekar on the other hand has genuine and original opinions and thoughts about the game which you may or may not agree to but makes listening to his commentary interesting.
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,">Bhogle, however, maintains it is worrisome that there is growing acceptance that broadcasters should align themselves on one side. “What I did explain [to Bachchan] was that on the Hindi telecast, we were very India-centric, though not biased, because the telecast was going only to this market. But we couldn't do that with the English telecast, as it was going to various countries. In the past, Indian listeners would get angry when foreign commentators did not speak enough about the Indian team. We cannot be like that to the others.“ 

Harsha was damn right!! Let him do his job.

comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,AB and MSD are perfectly entitled to their opinions (as Harsha agreed). But the onus is on BCCI not to be acting like puppets. BCCI on the first hand should not be even handing out commentary contracts. That should be the broadcaster.
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"Your opinion is actually correct that professional players should not be overtly sensitive, if any commentators say stupid stuff reply them with your performance. But I highly doubt despite his current standing within the team hierarchy jadeja can pull enough strings to get a commentator fired. BCCI does not like problem makers though, they favour politically correct people."

Yeah.. I also find that irritating occasionally.

Nah.. Most of the times he is unbiased and generally comments very well on whats happening. He also has this rare perspective of a commentator who didnt play that much cricket."

comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"I am not denying that Gambhir's record in England is not even decent, it is below par. Boycott is a bit harsh though, he is famous/infamous for his style of commentary. Especially that bit after poor Gambhir's dismissal was like sprinkling salt to an open wound, ""he's rubbish, isn't he, I have seen him play here earlier, he can't bat in England, in india where the pitches are flat and the balls don't bounce he's good there blah blah"". He verbally ripped the poor fellow apart😂"
comment,"Sanjay Manjrekar axed from BCCI’s commentary panel, may not be included in IPL 2020: Report - cricket",1265,"I feel that KKR, have adjusted their playing conditions according to Russel, Narine and Lynn, so much so that the boundary is ridiculously short and top edges of Lynn and Russel sometimes easily carry beyond the boundary. I see this as a harmful trend slowly encroaching all IPL teams. I want to see classy players like Yuvraj Singh, Shaw, Gill, Kohli etc. shine above baseball players like Pollard, Russel and Pant.

Now i have to warn you, this is not entirely based on facts. But just an observation. To be honest, i dont like players just whacking around with no particular skill apart from shear power."

By contrast, having an flagship ICC tournament take place without fans would be damaging both as a viewing experience and financially."

comment,IPL 2020 will begin from 19th Sept in UAE,1130,"From what I've read they've handled things fairly well. They've done the most testing per capita of any country in the world (excluding microstates) and had a strict evening curfew (which has since been relaxed in light of the improving situation), where they'd disinfect the streets every night as well.

Like all the Gulf countries they've had outbreaks in their migrant camps, but cases have been falling for a while now. It should be a pretty safe place to hold the IPL."

comment,IPL 2020 will begin from 19th Sept in UAE,1130,It’s definitely a lot easier to control in the UAE. A much smaller population has enabled them to test over 47% of the population as per worldometers.info.

There‘s positives and negatives. I hate it but I see the upsides."

Kumble really felt like a man on mission. He knew what he wanted, the limits he wanted to stay around and who to pick bidding fight with. 

He must have done his homework because he bought many underrrated players, and didn't go for even a single hyped entity. Like he didn't raise a single bid for Cummins, who was expected to be on everybody's radar.

comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Smith had such an incredible season with the RPS in 2017, whoever was involved in selecting the 11 and managing the team did a fantastic job in picking a very balanced side throughout the season. Heartbreaking to see the 1 run final loss."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Wow, Steve Smith is a really good captain. Maybe the Aussies should consider making him skipper of the national team?"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Woah, I didnt expect Rohit's number to be so close to Dhoni's. CSK always reach playoffs. MI do it in alternate years."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,I really don't understand why Dinesh Karthik is captain at KKR when they have one of the best LOI captains ever in Eoin Morgan playing for them.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"MSD, look at that number of matches and win percentage. In IPL, he is the best captain so far. Rohit will be the second best."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"MSD has to be the best even if just for that 2018 ""Dad's army"" comeback season. Just going totally against the tide of conventional wisdom.
He made Chahar and Shardul world beaters ffs!"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Man, Dhoni is an amazing captain. CSK, on paper, isn't the strongest team in the IPL, but they have consistently made it to the finals, semi-finals and won for most of the IPL seasons."

i am from punjab but i have no expectations from punjab team they are trash and also from RCB although they have silver cards published and i really like rajasthan and mumbai team and i like smith team coz it reminds me of orea strawberry flavour lol"

comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"The only reason the BCCI/RCB owners allow Kohli to captain in White Ball cricket is because they want him to remain the brand/face of Indian and RCB cricket. He might be awful as captain who has cost India  ICC trophies and RCB the IPL titles, yet his commerciability/marketability eclipses Rohit or any other Indian or global cricket. The decision to keep him as captain is mainly financial, and not about winning cricket games."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,Its surprising how Kohli clings on to captaincy!! Perks of being exceptional with the bat° tbh if he was in any other country he would have been thrown of the title much sooner.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,I am a MI FAN...but i really want KXIP to win this season.. excellent squad.. excellent skeeper.. coaching staff is good..
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,Clearly Dhoni. Look at the number of matches he has captained in we shouldn’t forget this includes the RPS season too. Can someone help me with his winning percentage excluding RPS season?
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,I’m no mathematician but I think 65% is the highest % listed

comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,Dhoni’s win percentage seems to be low compared to what I imagined. Somehow I thought it would be closer to 70% or more.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,Warner with 55% is really impressive because he’s been single handed my carrying the team while batting for 3 out of 4 years. Still think he’s a better captain than finch but he’s fucked it by being a twat.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,i really feel sad for him. He is been made captain for one of the most dumbest & illogical team  this season

Sometimes I feel, If Rohit Sharma was the captain of RCB , especially during the 2015-2018 period, RCB would've have won all the seasons. 🤦‍♂️😂"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Agree. Winning the match by one run is luck. How will you describe winning the matches in last overs, or last ball (hitting six, bowler bowling no ball)?"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,good idea. most likely they are waiting for pandemic to be over and no logistics issues with sandpaper supplies to get effective Smith
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Yup , 60% win rate after 174 matches - that’s his greatness."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Yea all things considered, it has to be Dhoni. 

Mumbai under Rohit has been great as well but they have a galacticos thing going on where they have fantastic star studded team that spends more than anyone. Plus their success has more to do with a phenomenal back room staff and amazing scouting. Finding Pandyas and Bumrah before anyone else is amazing. But Rohit is a good motivator and manages his resources well.

Chennai on the other hand is more of a captain's (and coach's) team. They are not about recruiting a huge back room staff or signing the biggest stars. They are about building a winning culture, putting the players in the best possible position to succeed and having a cool captain that guides them through any tough times. Whether it's Mohit Sharma, Gony, Chahar, Shardul or any other player that looks completely hapless anywhere else, when they play for CSK, they look really good, well prepared and they always deliver in big moments."

comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Morgan has been horrible in IPL, maybe pitches don't suit him in India.

So, if he shit the bed in batting again, he won't be picked in the 11, then franchise will be in shambles if they have to bench their captain.

Let, him score some runs and get into the team, if he did well and DK didn't work out for KKR(he reached playoffs last season, not bad) then Morgan will be the captain. Till then he is in leadership group and will help DK whenever it is required.

Also not to forget, English players arriving and leaving IPL late or early respectively. Which also cause issue and uncertainty. The reason Kane Williamson is picked and Root is unsold in auction."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"With only 4 overseas slots, Morgan was not even guaranteed a spot in the playing 11. So he wasn't considered for captaincy."

comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"> The decision to keep him as captain is mainly financial, and not about winning cricket games.

Not a fair assessment imo.

Under him we've got better win % across formats and he has lead India to the finals of CT2017 and the semis of WC 2019.

Even if the board wanted to remove him from the leadership role they would be clutching at straws to come up with a good enough excuse."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,He hasn’t cost india any world cups. They got outplayed in both the 2015 and 2019 World cups.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,Rohit Sharma's numbers include the matches that his team lost. If those weren't included his win % would be 100% afaik.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,His RPS season is included in it and he captained only 6 matches last year.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Nah, or else no one will play against India anymore. They will surrender before toss. After all who can go against such a legend amongst legend captain?"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"I beg to differ. In my opinion, he can be a very good captain and KXIP have a pretty decent team this time. Worst case they will finish #7 behind RCB"

here is a free meme 


my friend ~ did rcb win 

me ~ well no but actually no 

they literally throw off a won season 😂"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"He didn't have the best team. He created the best team. He didn't have the best players. He supported right players to let them flourish. RCB has also had many good players in the same time, but Virat failed to give them consistent chances. 


Note: I'm not saying the credit behind MI's or player's success goes to Rohit alone, the team management plays a big part in it. But it's him that's enforcing the decisions on the pitch afterall. Kohli also has a management behind him. But either they're not good(leaving KL Rahul for Sarfaraz) Or kohli fails to follow the gameplan. Whatever the results might be, it's his success or failure as a captain."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"That's true. He's calm and knows how to use his bowlers definitely deserves credit for that. But in this sort of victories, doesn't matter how calm you're it can swing either way.
Imagine winning by just 1 run, that too in IPL FINAL fucking two times.

There's gotta be some good luck factor."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Attributing such close margin victories to their captains wouldn't be fair to say the least.

India snatched victory from the jaws of defeat two games in a row against NZ in t20s. Would you say Kohli handles crutch situations better or is more calm than Kane?"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"I disagree, sure DC lost 2-3 matches last year due to not handling pressure situations better, but those were almost entirely upto individual performances(or lack thereof) at the end and wasn't in the captain's hands at all. RCB's failures are also upto Koach's poor selection policies and the inability to build a team"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"He played well for what was a very low scoring match and had ambati rayudu been fielding a metre away, the shot that got him out would have sealed it for them."

Huh what. This is not football. Everyone has the same auction purse.

And also about galacticos. RM buys superstars when they are superstars. MI didn't buy Bumrah, Pandya when they became stars. MI made them stars. They let them flourish."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"yeah its not like MI has twice the number of IPL trophies as CSK.

You guys have one more than us lol kinda harsh"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"It's not that the pitches don't suit him, Morgan never does well for franchise teams because he doesn't really care as much.

comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,Kohli didn't captain in 2015 and there were obvious selection blunders in the 2019 world cup that could have easily changed the result.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"His inability to build and back his team was a major reason for 2019 defeat. Lack of a middle order was not a problem that snuck up on the team out of the blue, he 2 years after the CT debacle to fix the problem, he and his chamcha failed."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Thats the conclusion one can arrive when they only see the WC matches. 

If you look closely, Kohli is solely responsible for No.4 fuckup. He saw the team had a no.4 problem in ICC champions trophy final. He had 2 years to try to rectify it. Safe to say, he did not with his stupid rotation policies."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"I edited it to ICC trophies. I think CT 17, winning the toss and batting second was a huge mistake. And of course, Kohli fiddled for over an year about number 4 and eventually settled for a mediocre Dinesh Karthik for WC 19 and the lack of clarity in Dhoni's role and lack of settled middle order cost the world cup."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,Team of 2016 is way diff from 2017 and don't forget mid season injuries of major players including smith.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Virat have to show some self respect. 
He is not winning any tournament for India nor for RCB.
Looks like he just holding on captaincy just to maintain his brand value.
Players like ABD, Aaron Finch and Rohit Sharma are better leaders than him."

He's god amongst men. The savior of game, our Messiah captain KL Rahul"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Because memes don't paint the full picture. People make the biggest jokes about RCB because it's fun and they want to feel like they belong with everyone else who is also meme-ing but they've almost never been among the worst teams. For most of their history, they've been a very good side that almost always made the playoffs and even finals but then go on to fail on the big stage.

It's just the last couple of years where they've actually been bad."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"If you're talking about the season where he scored around 973 runs.
Yes it was spectacular. But certainly not *Single Handedly*

Ab De Villiers scored around 700 runs(2nd or 3rd highest) that season while chahal & watson were the 2nd & 3rd highest wicket takers."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Which is why I said had Rohit been the captain , RCB would've won.

RCB had a really strong team during 2015-2018. But not a good captain.

Edit: Leaving KL Rahul for Sarfaraz was a blunder. Somewhere, I blamed Kohli too. While every other player was satisfied with the highest pay to be 15cr. ( Even Dhoni )

Kohli went on to demand 17cr. I have always hated him for that! That very move led to the downfall of RCB as they couldn't construct a team as stronger as it were during the 2015-2017 period."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"I agree, in fact quite a few MI title-winning teams were bang average I dare say - almost no ""superstars"" in the bona fide sense."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Lolol. xD

I guess talking about that would be against the rules & guidelines of this sub.

Otherwise, I could rant on the Ambani thing, anytime."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Yep, and RCB beat CSK by 1 run in the IPL, that doesn't mean Kohli is better than Dhoni either."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"If you've played 50 balls in a T20 game, scoring 51 is not justified by any means. All they (MS, Jinx and Smudge) had to do was have one big over between 10-15 overs but they were busy playing ODI."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"This isn't about overall history just record under captains, rohit became captain in 2014, since then he has captained us to a top 4 finish 4 times, winning the title 3 times. Dhoni in the same period has captained his team to top 4 finish every year except 2016,  but has only ipl trophy to show for it."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Shouldn't be playing if you don't care.

You don't get captaincy by not caring. So, it also doesn't make sense to make him captain."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,He did rectify it. He had even declared Rayudu as the Indian no. 4 for the WC before the IPL began. Then Rayudu had a disastrous IPL season where he struck at less than run a ball in ~~14~~ 17 matches. You can't take a player like that to the World Cup.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"DK never even batted at #4 for India at the WC. Besides, DK had done well for India at the Asia Cup and only came in to the side after Dhawan and Shankar got injured causing KL to move to opening."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Yup, the first season of RPS was a disaster with no foreign players being fit enough. Smith, Faf, Pietersen were injured."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"I dont think captaincy is a big deciding factor in T20 matches. 
The format is too short to use a lot of tactics. 
As long as you have excellent hitters and good death bowlers you are golden and most of the times captainship decisions wont alter the result. 

Thats the USP of T20. CHAOS. Its so dynamic and short that strategy doesn't work most of the times. 

So blaming Virat's captainship in IPL is not really a wise thing to say probably."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"> Players like ABD, Aaron Finch and Rohit Sharma are better leaders than him.

How did you come to the conclusion that Rohit's a better captain than him?"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"*JUST IGNORE THIS COMMENT* 


1. Captaining an IPL team vs Captaining a National Team makes a huge difference.

2. If he's such a great captain, then why is Manish Pandey Karnataka's ranji/vijay hazare/syed mustaaq ali captain? Even in Manish Pandey's absence, Karun Nair gets to be the Captain.
Given that people still prefer KL Rahul over them?


P.S I'm a huge RCB Fan. Also a KL Rahul fan. You wanna praise his batting skills? I'm all ears. 

But Rohit Sharma's captaining skills are way better. Anytime."

Ok then."

I don't see any value in that extra 2 crore apart from enforcing the fact that Kohli is leaps and bounds better batsman than other people getting 15 crores. He could have easily earned those 2 crores by doing few more promotional tweets/an ad shoot. Yes, he would have probably gotten more than 17 crore in the auction but I don't see his captaincy position as secure as anywhere else apart from RCB."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,2013 wasn't too big of a margin like 2015. I think csk lost by 20 runs or something
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,Exactly. People on this sub rush to attribute any and all progress purely to captains. Like the emergence of good Indian pacers gets attributed to Kohli's captaincy and England's recent LOI success gets attributed to Morgan.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Yeah but saying they reach play offs and we win then implies that there is a vast difference between both teams which was what I was pointing out.

Your initial statement is objectively false since we have won it three times and you have won it four times.

Rohit becoming captain in 2014 doesn't have anything to do with your initial statement which was quite blunt."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Morgan plays franchise cricket for the money and practice.

I'd still have Morgan as captain if only because Karthik is a bad one."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"We pick him, we keep him. Chepu at #3, Smith at #4, Virat at #5 would be my dream middle order come to life"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"You can. Because the formats are different. Trusting the players. That's the difference between Kohli and Dhoni/ Rohit. This is exactly why our notorious RTG came into existence. Because of kohli not trusting the players who deserved the trust.

And also Rayudu isn't the only player who was tried for no. 4 spot. A lot did. Iyer, Pandey, Rahane, Karthik. And why did this happen. Again Kohli's RTG."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Ah.. I'd argue the EXACT opposite. T20 is the format where a captains tactical decisions are most important precisely because of how short the game is. Captains have to think about a lot more and a lot faster during t20s compared to any other formats. Gotta consider match ups, protect shorter boundaries, flex the batting order etc etc.."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"But if you look at the consistency of some teams like that of MI, CSK or KKR under Gambhir, your argument doesn't hold water. What you said is right if you take the example of a team like West Indies. They perfom and then they don't. But they never come in with the element of consistency. Hence, captaincy matters in T20."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Lol have you seen Kohli's decision making in crunch situations? How many matches has RCB lost in the final 2 3 overs , matches that they should have won easily? RCB for years have had the best batting line-up a team could dream of. Even then they couldn't reach the playoffs half of the times."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Winning tournaments matter.
And if that doesn't happening under your leadership, that send a wrong message.  RCB management and virat are holding virat's captaincy just to maintain and increase their brand value and other capitalization aspects. 
But it's send wrong message about a person's character."

He isn't playing for his personal records, Dude has spirit of cricket award FFS!!!!"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,That game (2013) was dead in like the 8th over of CSK chase. 20 runs was a result of 12 overs of garbage time Dhoni scoring.
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Captains have a part to play, but attributing everything to captaincy is reductive. MI has Bumrah and Malinga, the best death bowler right now and one of the all time greats, obviously they'd handle pressure better than most other teams."

CSK- 10 play off apps 3 titles

MI- 8 play off apps 4 titles

KKR- 6 play off apps 2 titles

SRH-  5 play off apps 1 title.

MI are statistically the best team at actually winning the tournament when they finish in top 4. For dhoni its is even worse as he also made play offs with pune in 1 of his 2 years there and lost to MI."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"Yeah, I cannot agree with that. An out of form player in the IPL isn't suddenly going to light the 50 over format. 

>And also Rayudu isn't the only player who was tried for no. 4 spot. A lot did. Iyer, Pandey, Rahane, Karthik. And why did this happen. Again Kohli.

Between 2013-2015, Dhoni also tried Rahane, Yuvraj, Raina, Rayudu, DK and Kohli at #4. It's not a unique problem that emerged during Kohli's captaincy. You don't know your best player unless you try all your options. 

Besides, it's not like our #4 solution fared any better at the 2015 WC. We ended up losing that tournament in the semifinals too."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"No need to be absolutists guys. 
I am only saying that the captaincy doesnt matter that much. I never said it doesnt matter at all. 
The whole point was to not blame kohli completely on the failures of rcb. If you watch the matches with open minds you will realise wh@t I meant. 
To make it even more simple 
1) captaincy is not as important as the other formats so we should not give ot that much weight
2) kohli should not be blamed completely for RCB's failures. 

That does NOT mean that VK is not at all at fault. Or captaincy doesnt matter at all in T20."

The fact that MI have Jasprit Bumrah one of the world's best death bowlers, Hardik Pandya who is India's best Pinch Hitter and all rounder and Rohit Sharma whose one of India's best batters is the reason for their success. They've had easily the best squad in IPL for many editions."

comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"In 2015 WC, we had a very very strong batsman in Rahane, who could stabilise the innings if the top order collapses (which he did in the Semis upto some limits) and can also accelerate if he is put in to bat after 30-35 overs (like the South Africa game)

Backing Rahane at no.4 should have been an option even in the 2019 WC, considering his ODI form in 2017-18 (scoring 8 fifties and a hundred in just 12 games) before being dropped for no reason at all. He can switch roles and that's why he makes a perfect no.4"

Can you list all the series and tournaments Rohit Sharma has captained so that we can critique them? I think he was the captain in Nidahas Trophy but I can't remember any other tournament off the top of my head."
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,"> Whenever Sharma Captained the side, he had 'B' grade team such as no Kohli, Bumrah etc. yet he has better win % than Kohli.

That might have something to do with the fact that he's only ever played against teams like Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and West Indies.

I do remember the one time he captained against NZ though. India had bundled out for a score of sub 100 with Kuldeep and Chahal top scoring.

> I bet if Bumrah and Pandya had debuted under Kohli in RCB they would have been nowhere near what they're now.

That's like your opinion and there's nothing to suggest that they couldn't have been better off under Kohli.

> On the other side, whenever Kohli's the captain he gets the best team, yet hasn't won a significant title.

He's only ever captained in 2 major events. One in which the team was a finalist and in the other they were semi finalists. I'd say that those are decent results for the lineups we've had."

Navdeep Saini and Shivam Dube have only started playing international cricket after IPL 2019. 

Washington Sundar had played some t20i before but he'd basically farmed his stats in the Nidahas trophy.

Yuzvendra Chahal is the only one whose been a regular for a while and isn't particularly great in the format.

Imo the talent playing under Rohit and Virat is not even comparable especially if you consider IPL 2019."

You're right he doesn't have the rapport with the fans that Karthik does but if he started winning games, that would change quickly. He's also a world-renowned WC winning captain.

Yes, he hasn't hit the runs in the IPL but did Karthik have a great season last year? Don't remember him scoring runs for fun.

Captaining a first class side is not the same as captaining a limited overs side. I'm not saying Karthik has no captaincy experience but his record after 36 games isn't great.

To add to this, Morgan is one of only two players to have won a WC as captain in this year's IPL and he's not captaining his side? I also think Williamson should be captaining Hyderabad, to be honest."

The world no .2 batsman in ODI with 3 double hundreds and 5 world cup hundreds in a season and single handedly carried the entire team to the semi finals , highest averaging batsmen after Kohli  and 2 nd highest in number of hundreds since 2013 , whom Kohli itself titled the best limited over batsmen in thr world ??? Do you know Rohit's average in matches india won?? Butler's come nowhere close . Hell for me ben stokes is a better batsmen than butler. The only thing in which butler trumps rohit is in strike rate. But rohit has the second highest strike in middle overs after butler. And coming to  captaincy india has won the asia cup and nidhas trophy under rohit and also won series against Bangladesh, west indies, srilanka in both t 20 s and odis with b team without kohli,pandya or bumrah or even shami and bhuvi for that matter.Dont try to undermine a player just because you are a blind fan or hater. So many former players and commentators have said that rohit would be a better captain . Sachin was a terrible captain but that doesn't take away any achievement from him. Kohli is the best overall batsman in the world right now but definitely not a very good captain"
comment,IPL captaincy record of 2020 season captains,758,">Williamson should be captaining Hyderabad

If Williamson makes into team it will be a surprise.

Bairstow and Warner will be the ones who will be foreign pick for batting. Rashid will be spin option and one fast bowler in foreign category/Nabi.

2018- DK scored 498 runs at 49 with strike rate of 147.
2019 - he batted down the order, scored 253 at 32 with strike rate of 146.

He has been pretty good actually.

All I am saying is, there is no hurry for Morgan. If Karthik doesn't deliver and Morgan does well who knows he might be the captain next year."

comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"The reason why 50% of cricketers are born in the months of September to December is probably the [Relative Age Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_age_effect). It's pretty cool.

comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"The cutoff for under 19 ages and normal cricket is to be of a specific age by august of a particular year. So those born in September October November are comparatively older and more developed than those born in the second half of that cycle! 

Example: suppose the requirement to qualify for 2021 season is that you need to be 21 by September 1st 2020. So all those who are allowed to participate must be born between September 1999 to August 2000! So those who are born in sept - dec are comparatively more developed. 

I believe this difference is more pronounced when they are younger and diminishes as you get older!"
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Using the September 1 cutoff, it means that at the Under 19 level, a player that turns 19 on September 1 will be nearly a year older than a player who turns 19 on August 31, but they will be in the same age group.

Having an extra year of physical and mental development helps give them an advantage.

As another example, if you had two kids with adjacent birth dates - say one was born on August 31, while the other was born on September 1 of the same year. The kid that was born on August 31 would play in an older age group, with kids up to a year older than them, while the kid born on September 1 would play in the age group lower than their friend, while playing with kids up to a year younger than them.

Where this matters is when boards allocate spots in academies, national and state Under 19 teams and other development opportunities. Having an extra year will definitely help get attention."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Not sure about other countries but in the UK school years start in September and traditionally this is how sports teams arrange their age groups as well.

If you want to calculate it, then first find out the probability that all 23 have different birthdays. Then subtract it from 1(total probability)

Probability that all 23 have different birthday = 365×364...×(365-22) / 365^23"
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Consider 2 people. The probability that the two of them share a bday is P = 1/365, so the probability that they don't share a bday P' = 1 - P = 364/365 = 0.9972.

Now, extend it to 3 people. The probability P that none share a bday is 1 - ((364/365)\*(363/365)) = 0.9917. As you keep increasing the number of samples from 3 towards 23, P' decreases to 50.

Another way to look at it is even if there are 23 people, each bday is compared to every other bday, so there are (23\*22)/(2) = 253 comparisons."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"A lot of people are giving you very technical reasons, but here's what helped me understand it. The birthday problem isn't about individual people, but about the connection between people. 

So, within a group of people, there's a network of connections. When there are 3 people, there are 3 connections. When there are 4 people, there are 6 connections. When there are 5 people, there are 10 connections.

As you add more and more people, the number of connections increases by a larger and later amount. By the time you get to 23 people the network is large enough and there are enough connections that the probability of any 2 of those sharing the same birthday is around 50%

To really understand it, you have to stop looking at it as people, but connections within a network."

Essentially your calculating the probability of not having the same birthday

Multiplied all together gives~.5 or 50%"
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"This isn't the technical reason but it helps with the intuition. 

P (23rd person doesn't share birthday) = 22/365 

P (22nd person doesn't share birthday) = 21/365

P (2nd person doesn't share birthday = 1/365

Else, Number each player 1-23. Pairs  which include Player 1 are: (1, 2), (1, 3), ... (1, 23)  ie, 22 pairs for player 1.  For player 2, pairs are: (2,3), (2,4)... (2, 23), ie, 21 pairs.  Continuing this way, total pairs = 22 + 21 + 20 + ... 1 = 253.

2.
If numerator is 1, this means all 23 players have birthday on some specific day(say Jan 1). If numerator is 365, this means all the players have birthday on the same day(can be any day among 365 days).

For unique birthday, player 1 can choose any day, so he has 365 choices. Player 2 has 364, ... Player 23 has (365-22) choices. So total number of favorable outcomes = 365×364x...(365-22)."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Player 1 - Has bday on any date

Player 2 - Can have bday on any date apart from the above (So 365-1= 364 days)

Player 3- Can have bday on any date apart from the above two (So 365-2 = 363 days)

That's why it keeps on decreasing. The probabilities are multiplicative here (e.g Toss 1 coin, Heads once has 1/2 chance, toss a coin twice, heads at least once has 3/4 chance)

The every other bday part is how you many combinations of players you can make. Of a squad of 23, you can select two players in 23c2 ways, which is (23*22)/(2*1)"
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"For 3 people, you are basically calculating 
[Probability that Guy2 has a different birthday than Guy1] * [Probability that Guy3 has a different birthday than both Guy1 and Guy2]. You are multiplying probabilities as they are independent events.

The first one is 364/365, the second is 363/365. You can similarly extend it to any number of people."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Let's say there are two people: Jack and Jill.

Jack and Jill have a connection between them.

If another person joins, Joe.

There is a connection between Jack and Joe. Jill and Joe. Jack and Jill.

There is no actual connection, it's just a theoretical link between two people."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Say there's 23 people in a room , named person 1,person 2 and so on.

Say their birthdays are date1,date2 and so on.

First you compare borthdates of person 1 and person 2,then person 1 and person 3,them person 1 and person 4 and so on.

But this way you will have only checked if someone shares a birthday with person 1.You haven't checked whether person 2 and person 5 share birthday or not.

So you set out to check if person 2 shares a birthday with someone else present in the room.However, you have already compared birthdays of person 1 and person 2, so you'll have to kick person 1 out of the room.
Now you compare birthdays of person 2 and person 3 then person 2 and person 4 then person 2 and person 5.  But what if person 3 and person 4 share a birthday? You would have still missed it.

So you have to repeat the process until there's only person in the room.

We found a quick way to calculate the number of days that will have been compared which in the case is written as 23(superscript)C2(subscript).

This symbol : m (superscript ) C n(subscript) represents a no. equal to the no. of ways of selecting n items from m items,here the items are people whose birthday we compare.

So because we have to choose 2 people among 23 we write it as 23(superscript)C 2(subscript) which is equal to 23!/(23-2)!2!. It comes out to be 23x11 days which is just more than half the days in a year. And so it's a slightly more than 50% chance that a birthday is shared."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Sorry, that should be the probability that the 23rd person shares a birthday with one of them.

comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"So the first person can compare their age to all 22 of the other people, then the next person has already compared their age to the first person so there are only 21 left to compare to, the next person only needs to compare to 20 people, etc"

Finally you would have compared 23 C 2 days 

Sorry for late reply

comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,Average length of a professional cricket players career is probably 10 years so 6 years seems long enough
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Under age competitions. So for cricket it's September. So if you want to play for say, England U18s you have an advantage if you were born just after the cutoff as you could be nearly a full year older then someone born in August of next year. 

If you make the various underage teams you will get better coaching etc from being in 'the system' making it more likely you will turn pro.

Cricket has age group teams from at least U13 (we did in Ireland anyway), and at that age the difference in a year is even bigger."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Basically during junior sports competitions where they have like under-13's and so on, they need to have a cutoff date for separating the ages. So when I played cricket as a junior, the cutoff was October 1st. If you were born September 30th or before, you were 'too old' for U-13's if you had turned 13 that year, but if you were born October 1st or after and turned 13, you were fine. I was born after October 1st, but not by much, so I was able to play in U-13's as a 13 year old.

However my birthday was not an advantage when I played basketball, the cutoff was January 1st, so a calendar year. So I was playing against people that were up to 9 months older than me.

This phenomenon (linked in the first message of this thread) shows that many professional sports people are born in a small range of months, such as NHL players born in the first 3 months of the year, because the junior ice hockey cutoff is January 1st. As a kid, the difference in being born 6-12 months later can be big, so the best junior teams will likely choose the biggest kids, which would be born closer to the cutoff, most likely, unless there happens to be a naturally big or naturally talented kid born later in the year. This means these big kids born early in the year get better coaching, usually more practice which means that the average player born earlier in the year will end up being more skilled than the average player born later in the year, on average, which also then compounds by how many years they end up playing.

There is a chapter about this in Malcolm Gladwell's book 'Outliers'."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"23!= 23x22x(21!) So you can cancel the 21! from the numerator and the denominator.

comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,">3/4

They are two separate scenarios.

We are taking the negation of the unfavourable event, essentially subtracting from 100% the chance of getting no favourable outcomes.

For Heads at least once, it means (1-both times tails)= 1- (1/2\*1/2)

For tails at least once, it means (1-both times heads)= 1- (1/2\*1/2)

Edit - To explain the probability in a single scenario, take the possible outcomes. HH,HT,TH,TT = The number of times heads or tails comes up at least once is three out of four."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,Why is it written as 1/2 * 1/2 tho? Why isn't it added?
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Permutation takes into consideration the order of arrangement of objects or items.
Imagine that these people were actually sitting on chairs with a tag on it that corresponds to the number.
You can arrange those chairs in 23! ways, however the probability of people sharing birthday is completely independent of the way they are seated or the chair they are seated on.
Hence this is a combination scenario not a permutation one"
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,"Because probability isnt additive here, its multiplicative because its two different coin tosses.

Easy explanation - You toss 1 coin. Probability of H=1/2, Probability of T=1/2. Now you can add and say probability of either getting H or T is 1 (or guaranteed)

You toss 2 coins. At least 1 Head is 3/4, because there is a 1/4 probability both come up Tails. You cant add 1/2+1/2 here, there is no way to guarantee a head on two separate coin tosses, is there?"
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,1506,">You cant add 1/2+1/2 here, there is no way to guarantee a head on two separate coin tosses, is there?

So we're adding 1/2 in first case because we KNOW that heads can come with 1/2 probability, but in 2nd case with 2 coins, there's a chance heads may not come twice skewing the probability result?"

comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,2021 Rajasthan Royals might be 2020 SRH. Other than that restof the table should look same for rest of the season
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,Last season at this exact stage everyone thought the top 3 was decided and called it boring. Of course later DC and RCB had losing streaks and KXIP had a fantastic winning streak which made the IPL interesting. The only difference you can say is that KKR even though they were 4th weren't looking good and this year at 4th is MI and ever since they left Chennai they are looking better than ever.
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"Even though the table looks exactly the same, wait for the IPL scriptwriters to fool you with the climax /s"
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"RR looking good now. With Buttler in good form and Samson finding consistency, out batting is good. Issue is our bowling. Spin department is absolutely poor."

comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"last year SRH squeezed in and eliminated KKR lets what happens this year, i hope some bottom team knocks of MI out"
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,Basically heading towards CSK vs MI final again.. This repetitive nature of same teams winning is making ipl boring.
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"lets be honest, thats the 4 going to the playoffs. SRH are done, likewise KKR. Punjab without KL is nowhere near the same, RR dont have consistent performers.."

comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"I think there were many close games between top 4 and bottom 4 teams. This year, most games between them were one sided so it doesn't feel like bottom 4 can compete."
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"Probably because KKR and SRH look completely off the pace and don't feels threatening at all. RR are hamstrung and now so are PK. Last season the bottom two, CSK and KXIP were still pretty decent and matches against them were real contests, plus RR and KKR were real contenders."
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,I feel RR will pull it off and end up at 4th position
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"Which won't really happen until the very end of the tournament. All of CSK, RCB, DC and MI's final 3 matches are against each other."
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"Yes. Take a look at the grounds where we are playing our remaining matches, 2 more coming up in Delhi before we move to Bangalore for 3 matches and to Kolkata for the last 2 matches. Given that Brohit looks in a good touch this season, the Kolkata leg is what I'm looking forward to. Whatever happens, I just want us to crush our opponent in the last match, with a 70+ runs or 30+ balls remaining victory."
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,But the name... i dont know why they changed the name. Kings XI Punjab honestly was one of the best names in the tourney. PBKS sounds even worse for an acronym

Until the penultimate match (DC vs RCB) was done, it was not farfetched at all that one of DC and RCB would be kicked out because of NRR."

ever since shikhar went delhi ,Delhi emerged as big team and You can see how SRH are..

comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"Not really, bcoz rr, srh, punjab probably won't make a comeback. The only team who might is kkr, they just need to fire together"
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,From the looks of the 2020 table and if the same happens with final positions and  halfway positions I'd say MI wont make it but now they play on good batting pitches  so it's very unlikely that any of the bottom 4 can make it at this point.

comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,He went for 5.5 cr in the auction and SRH used RTM. According to the rules they aren't allowed to pay him more than the amount he was bought at
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,They could have retained him for 7Cr.
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"Yep. On a serious note, there's no chance of complacency for Mumbai Indians if they wanna grab one of the top two spots. Qualification for the playoffs, on the other hand, is more likely guaranteed for them at this point."
comment,Points table at the halfway of the IPL season-2020 vs 2021,788,"You see, the other 7 teams are praying that you don't qualify at all!

MI and DC were on 18 and 16 points and respectively and rest of the teams had 12-14 points each.

comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,"To be fair, you have to have a very high pain tolerance to be a fan of CSK. The pain inflicted by the players on their fans is extremely slow, and without a solid grasp of sadism, most viewers will turn off their TV. There's also middle order's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their personal philosophy draws heavily from Ted Bundy, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the mental capacity to truly accept the pain, to realise that they're not just unbearable- they say something deep about DEATH. As a consequence people who dislike CSK truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the desperation in CSK's  existential catchphrase ""Do it for the NRR,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to joker's Quote ""Do I really look like a guy with a plan?"". I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dhoni's genius tactic unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,"This RCB team is definitely the most balanced in the recent times. When there are two world class batsmen in Kohli and ABD, all we needed was solid Indian batting back up which we got now in Padikkal+Dube and invest in overseas bowlers. They are not necessarily the next big thing but just solid enough to free up Kohli and ABD. I don't think RCB are championship winning material yet, but with some experience for the likes of Padikkal, Dube and Sundar we might give it a good go next time. Also, so far we have played mostly on the bigger grounds which I think is a huge advantage for RCB with a relatively weak bowling and lack of outright six hitters. We routinely struggle in IPL because random sloggers can just outhit quality batsmen at smaller grounds and the advantage of having Kohli+ABD is neutralized to an extent. Predicting we will struggle in Sharjah for sure."

Run-a-ball till the 30s, then go crazy. Mayank did the same thing against Delhi, scoring sedately and then suddenly accelerating. You can't waltz around with that strike rate after facing 40+ balls in T20 cricket."

Finch out Moeen In and Parthiv in for free traveler Gurkeerat.

Don't feel right to force ABD to keep."

But the team management have fucked up team selection big time.

Youngsters need to be given a chance.

Playing Bravo, if he only bowls and doesn't bat higher, is just waste for the foreign player slot.

May be trade some players mid season, to salvage the season."

How do you tuk tuk 17 overs, win this and then give 3 wickets to chris morris. Why don't you send in umesh a guy with over 150 strike rate with the ball over a sri lankan slow ball boi in a cluch situation. Why not send siraj when he was actually able to give countless boundaries last year. Why does the skipper have to make run a ball until 50 and then destroy the death overs. I'm so done with this shit. Match after match. Atleast the other fans have some hope every year to make it to the playoffs. We have no hope and yet you're making us believe like the 2016 season."

I don't see a comeback from them from here unless there is a miracle.   Batting is been most worrisome area where CSK lacking power. Yesteryears chasing magic by Bravo,Jadeja and co is not happening. Perhaps it's the age which be catching up with bravo and MS. Overall it's a sad tournament for CSK until now."
comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,"I don't really think any change in team combination or batting order, or captaincy decisions will help CSK at this point; they're just not a good side, compared to the other teams."
comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,Csk were so overconfident about their dads army that they let guys like Billings and Willey go. Now they are looking like a cat on a got tin roof 😂

comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,This is very much due to Kohli Masterclass. He didn't give his wicket and played till the end. Hopefully he continues with his form.
comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,"Watching CSK bat is such a bore. Even in the last two seasons when they were doing well, all the fun was in the last 3 overs. This time not even that.

I really don't get the mentality of taking it deep. But somehow it won them a cup and a brought them to finals in the last two seasons.

Why would you not start hitting when it's 70 from 6 overs. Instead CSK eats up so many dot balls and tries hitting 55 from 3 overs. Saving wickets is pointless if the new batsman coming in has to hit every ball for a boundary."
comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,"Hell yeah! Finally a win against csk and out death bowling not giving freebies

Still that was a tense first innings if not for kohlis heroics at the end. We need a middle order hitter because if kohli and abd fails we're done.

I commented on the match thread that I won't say anything until the match is over because I didn't want rcb to do another rcb but thankfully that didn't happen and Morris you did exceptionally well!"

comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,"Bravo being picked over Ngidi / Hazelwood is a weird choice. They are not even utilizing his batting so it makes it even more atrocious. Bravo is not who he used to be.

He is there in the team just because Dhoni is comfortable with him and knows him well. The same reason Jadhav is in the team. You pick the familiar guy if they are in a similar skill level but picking Bravo over Ngidi because he bowled 2 no balls does not seem proper to me."
comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,"Dhoni in post match presentation - batsmen should try to hit and show intent. It doesn't matter if they get out.

Dude you have been doing the exact opposite in the last few matches. He is not capable of taking it deep in his current state. Hope he has realized it and starts hitting early."

comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,"Yeah he’s apparently worked really hard behind the scenes and has reaped the rewards today. I reckon that RCB have finally found the balance that they need in the team, especially with the move for ABD to take the gloves and for Morris to come in for Zampa. A variations merchant in Udana, Saini as the enforcer, Morris as the balanced bowler who can bowl anywhere, Sundar to dry up runs at the beginning and in the middle overs, Chahal for some genuine spin and partnership breaking, and Dube as a solid sixth bowler. The batting is also formidable, and now they can bat right down till 9, maybe even 10 if you count Saini. The only weak link seems to be Finchy against a swinging ball but I’d back him to come good. The only changes I would make are rotating Udana and Moeen dependent on conditions.

Honestly, if Rajasthan don’t make it to the playoffs (which they probably won’t) I may throw my lot in with Bangalore, it’d be awesome to see them win for the first time and basically sum up the craziness of 2020 in a nutshell."

This kind of season was going to happen with CSK and tbf even in these dire straits there are positives. That game against KXIP was a joy to watch concerning Faf and Watto, the win against MI was lovely and when the players try, like Dhoni in the last 2 games or Jagadeesan in this game, it is heart warming and truly gives satisfaction even when the losses pile up. We already have a couple good youngsters and I'm fully confident that a bit of rehauling and classic CSK craftiness will get us back to speed in the next couple seasons."

I do think that Dhoni was playing less tuk tuk in the KKR game and even the RCB game now. Also Jagadeesan was quite impressive on debut. We probably won't qualify but the team has raised at least some intent since that torrid three losses in a row and I'll be looking forward to the SRH match up.

comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,I think he has realised this and started hitting every ball today as soon as he came. I think he might change the batting line-up as well. We can get a batsman instead of Bravo if he's gonna bowl only two overs or so anyway and going to face only like one over of batting. He has not had much impact for the team. The only positive today was Jagadeesan looking in good form...
comment,"Post Match Thread - 25th Match of IPL, RCB vs CSK at Dubai, Oct 10 2020",243,"Im still reminded of how Rohit flops when he's captaining India in Kohli's absence, and yet India has won 81% of those matches under him.

Nidhas Trophy and DK are forever etched in our memory.
It's the same case with MI. Rohit seems to value winning more than his personal records. It's the same at WC'19. He broke down during the NZ Semis, despite a record breaking 5 centuries in a single World Cup. 

Kohli seems to value himself more, which is good because when Kohli fires, India fires too.
But when Kohli fails, especially at the ICC events, we never recover.

And our lack of trophy wins are proof of that.
But hey the guy (VK) looks sharp, scores well, and behaves alpha on the field, so he's clearly better than the Vada Pav loving Rohit right?

The IPL cup wins with inferior squads compared to RCB notwithstanding."

That's the dumbest logic I've ever heard. It just means we're that much dependent on Kohli. How are his batting and captaincy related? Kohli values himself more so India lose when he doesn't perform? Wtf are you on about? So he intentionally makes India lose when he doesn't perform? 

>idhas Trophy and DK are forever etched in our memory. It's the same case with MI. Rohit seems to value winning more than his personal records. 

And how us that Rohit's achievement? We Indians have a bad habit of attributing everything to captaincy. Sometimes individual performances make you win games. They've got nothing to do with captaincy. 

And Rohit captained India in Asia Cup and Nidahas Trophy. So against weak ass teams. Also a pretty small sample space. Virat Kohli is one of India's most successful captains *already*."

(IPL aside) Finch has a solid and consistent T20 and T20I record while Phillipe has only really performed so far against bowlers in the Big Bash while playing for the Sixers. The experience and tactical knowledge that Finch brings would also be missed.

There's more chance of Raina having sucked off MS atleast once then him being jealous due to some fuck**g balcony."
comment,"""Gangsters Killed Entire Family"": Suresh Raina On Sudden IPL 2020 Season Withdrawal",321,That’s his character. He’s also made statements about why women shouldn’t be cricketer and there should be no WIPL or something like that in the past so can’t expect him to be some good guy

The way Raina has been sidelined after 2022 from csk does nothing to dispel this story of a rift.

Not even sure what the issue ultimately is but overall a very shabby treatment of such a decorated player."

comment,DC’s Century Drought: 39 IPL Tons Since Our Last in 2020 – Who will Break the Jinx in 2025?,49,"A century doesn’t guarantee a trophy, but it significantly increases a team’s chances of winning individual games, which in turn helps them reach the final.

Last year, both finalist teams had century-makers (Head and Narine). Teams reach the final through consistent performances, and centuries play a big role in that. However, the eventual winner is the team that performs better on the day of the final.

When a player scores a hundred, their team wins about 75% of the time. Whether it’s Kohli’s six centuries or Buttler’s four in 2022, both teams made it to the final. They didnt win because they didnt perform well on that particular day. 

Obviously, No hundred doesnt mean No trophy but Hundreds are good to have like any other stats in Cricket."
comment,DC’s Century Drought: 39 IPL Tons Since Our Last in 2020 – Who will Break the Jinx in 2025?,49,"The thing is, ipl has changed a lot in the last 2 years and you cannot take 60+ balls to score a hundred anymore because you’ll be costing your team negatively more than helping them.

Out of 25 IPL tons that turned out to be on the losing side, only 7 had more than 200+ strike rate (Which includes Pant's blinder inning of 63 balls 128 against SRH as well)"
comment,DC’s Century Drought: 39 IPL Tons Since Our Last in 2020 – Who will Break the Jinx in 2025?,49,"Yes but if you think about how Kohli’s monster 2016 season had 60 ball 100s which won RCB most of those games, in today’s ipl the opposition team would want the player to score a 60 ball 100"

The only way Banton can play is if they drop Narine, but that'll mean Russell and Rana sharing the fifth bowler's duties, which is a risk."

comment,Tom Banton Smashed 5 6s in an over 0 6 6 6 6 6 He is part of KKR in 2020 IPL,1053,Not saying you're wrong but from what I've seen so far in the BBL he's only been playing two shots: the mow across the line over deep wicket and the slightly straighter mow across the line over cow corner. If he does have more class he's going to have to start showing it because as others have said this current MO probably isn't going to work in the IPL. It hasn't really worked in BBL other than this innings

He did it when it wasn't cool. Also KKR need captaincy and middle order firepower/stability. Their top order is mostly sorted. I could see him coming in place of Narine but the guy  has been improving (in bowling) since last IPL ( he was terrible) and is one of the best T20 spinners ever. If Narine isn't bowling well I'd get Banton in the side."
comment,Tom Banton Smashed 5 6s in an over 0 6 6 6 6 6 He is part of KKR in 2020 IPL,1053,"They'll be lucky to get four overs of Russell in five games out of 14. And while Cummins is pretty good, T20 is not his strongest format. It's still a pretty rookie bowling attack, so there's no way they'll drop Narine."

comment,Tom Banton Smashed 5 6s in an over 0 6 6 6 6 6 He is part of KKR in 2020 IPL,1053,"Is there even such a thing as ""white ball technique"" lol? /s I always thought white ball cricket requires a different temperament and style, as in more aggression and risk taking, apart from a wider range of shots and innovation. The pitches are batting friendly, ball doesn't swing and bowlers these days aren't great at bowling yorkers. Why Roy, Bairstow and Buttler succeed in LOIs rather than in tests is because of easier batting conditions (flatter pitches, consistent pace and bounce, pretty much no swing, shorter boundaries, fielding restrictions and defensive bowlers) and more reward for aggressive batting."
comment,Tom Banton Smashed 5 6s in an over 0 6 6 6 6 6 He is part of KKR in 2020 IPL,1053,"Was at the game last night (which fucking sucked as a thunder fan), and first ball of the match Banton hooked one off his nose for 6 over backward square off the leading wicket taker of bbl 09.

comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746, He would have retired yesterday if we had won the wc 2023.... He is 37. He wants to play for atleast 3 yrs i.e 2027 wc. He has to concentrate on fitness and it is not going to be easy bcoz he is aging.
comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746,2023 WC 🥺
comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746,The quality of this Indian team is really good and we have a team for every condition. We just need to keep another 12 players ready for replacements as and when required. India A team should keep playing matches so that the replacements are match-fit.

comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746,"Dhoni and Rohit are probably the best we will get , i dont see anyone becoming that good in coming 20 years as captain"
comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746,"In my opinion, Rohit Sharma should have been made captain way before. Rather instead of Kohli, Rohit should have been the captain. No doubt Virat is a great batsman, but having Rohit taking the load of captaincy, it would have been ideal situation for both."
comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746,"One advantage india had was experience, we played against inexperienced Aus attack and also same goes with NZ. I feel Rohit is very lucky. He not only has great cricketing mind as a captain , immense talent as a batsman but also tons of good luck."

comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746,"What about the Asia Cup we won in ‘10, ‘16, ‘18 & ‘23 ?"
comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746,"I think Rohit's legacy as a white ball captain would be that he was able to detach process from the results something MSD talks about and has done successfully. You can't just say that we look at knockouts as just another game and then change your playing style as soon as you're put under just a little bit of pressure. 

And if we hadn't done pitch fixing in the finals who knows we might have won that tournament too, but having said that I think it's time for Rohit the captain to step down from captaincy and if he plays till 27 he needs to play as an opener."
comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746,Vada paav ain't fit to play more. Time for him to retire. Unless he wins with the help of bookies like his b-i-l Bunty.

comment,Rohit sharma as a captain in international cricket!,1746,"If they are nothing, so why did India fight with full squad in that tournament? Every icc tournament equally matters. I would any day take a T20 WC and Champions Trophy than only an ODI World Cup. 1 is better than 2."

Otherwise Rohit already lost that match due to his captaincy,

comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"I understand that they're going for a major revamp, but RR releasing Tripathi seems like a very strange decision to me when they completely fucked his batting position the last season in order to accomodate Rahane. RCB could really use someone like him though in place of PP if ABD can keep."
comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"I think SRH missed a trick by not trading one of their dispensible fast bowlers. They have Bhuvneshwar, Kaul, Khaleel, Sandeep, and Basil.

RCB should give up on this year’s auction and try next year. The next year would be a mega-auction and would allow them to buy more players.

SRH might have less than other teams. But then again, that 17Cr is almost exclusively for Middle-order purchases. 

RR are too reliant on Buttler, Stokes and Archer. They got trapped. They will lose their key players during playoffs."

comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,SRH must go for Tripathi. He was excellent in his first season as an opener but not all that bad even as a middle order player later.

Now I hope that Nagarkoti and Mavi are finally fit and can play this season. Will need a few all rounders and top order batsmen too.

Karthik, Russell, Rana, Narine, Kuldeep, Gill will feature in the XI for sure.

2 of Nagarkoti, Mavi and Lad will play too.

1 of Lockie and Gurney as well.

That's 9 spots sorted out in the XI. Now all we need are 2 top-order batsmen. Guptill and Evin Lewis won't be bad choices. Would prefer Lewis over Guptill though."

comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"We are not bad as you point out too. 

Our XI:- 

1) gayle- for 2 crore, he is a gem. He gave us almost 500 runs last year at explosive Sr, backing him is a smart move, and we have alternatives anyway

2) rahul- best player in ipl since 2018. Gem of a t20 cricketer

3) mayank- experienced koi player with now international level confidence

4( sarfarz khan- was a cheeky player, hugely talented, Kumble will back him. He was in runs last year before we dropped him unfairly. He will be treated better this year

5) pooran- explosive wicket keeper option for Punjab, Miller replacement that can finish games. Huge plus for us

6) pace alrounders. Yes that we need

7) gowtham- spin alrounders that can bat, experienced in ipl and can settle in well under Kumble

8) murugan ashwin- very good spinner. Economical and can bowl well under pressure. Will only succeed more under Kumble.

9) Suchith/mujeeb- mujeeb has been top 3 in t20I, will redeem himself this year. Kumble also likes to work with Suchith who can be a good option for replacement. 

10) Shami- experienced Indian pacer. They are hard to get and we have one of the top 3 pacer for India. His economy is a little bad, but his wicket taking ability is massive. Partner him with a better fast bowling option, and we will be going places

11) foreign pacer- yes we need a good experienced international level pacer, but Luckily we have 42 crore budget for it. We also have vijoen in case 

Backups- for batting, we have Karun nair who is easily official XI level. We also have Mandeep Singh, who has potential to be explosive and a set player. In case of any failures, we can accommodate batting easily

For bowling, we have 4 spinning options, and harpreet brar too. In pace, we have arshdeep Singh too, who was really good in his ipl debut last year, will only get better

For 42 crore, we just need a foreign main pacer, an alrounder, and maybe a foreign experienced batsman, likes of kane/morgan that can strengthen us and play the Bailey role."

Anyone's bowling will get murdered on that pitch. It is nothing but flat, makes for very good batting. Not to forget, the ridiculously small boundery rope means that even not properly timed shots could fetch you runs. 

If I were Kohli, then I'd request the pitch to assist bowlers A LOT - where 120-150 is par. That's probably the only way they can somehow make it through - by having Kohli and AB play at 6 runs/over and take it easy. And let's be real, Kohli and AB can play through spin, swing, and anything else, it won't be a major problem for them. 

What's the point of having two of the best players of their generation if you are thinking about protecting them from falling to something like lateral movement or turn?"

comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"Samson most likely ,as with Rahul Tripathi  he was getting shifted down the order  to accommodate Rahane at the top .If they open It frees up the no: 3 spot for smith for the entire season and stokes can be used mostly at 4(maybe 5 if  Riyan Parag in is the 11) than be send in as a  finisher which didn't suit him.

Only issue with that is with Gowthan and Binny(did well in the last couple of games) gone they some proper muscle down the order.If Morris retains any semblance of the form he showcased for delhi in his peak he is  probably the best candidate to go for(or maybe go for maxwell if he is there and hope for the best) as it would also give another bowling option to turn to incase stokes, aaron or rajpoot all disappoint with the ball in hand.

The other way to go about to look for a foreign opener in the mold of Finch or  Munro to open and turn Butler into the finisher,though given how well he has done as an opener probably not best to tweak something that's working for you.  


With a strong english core already in the team i wont be even surprised if they go after someone like morgan to add some muscle either."

I don't think we would be able to get Jaiswal with the purse we have and the hype around, have a feeling we will go for Anmolpreet singh's brother Prabhsimran Singh (KXIP just released him) we tried to get him even in last auction before our he went out of our budget, one of our coach even called him ""Right handed Rishabh Pant"" in 2018 and I remember the same guy predicted that Rishabh Pant will be a star in 2016 when he wasn't even a IPL star. He has been inconsistent in current SMA trophy but worth the gamble for future I guess. I can't see anyone who is readymade product in domestic who will fit in XI in case Ishan Kishan is not in form, even Ishan Kishan rarely got to bat with decent amount of balls left in last IPL, our top 3 bats till 11-12th over and then our finishers starts coming in."

I've seen everyone of his matches, and for a kid who's bowling first time in India, he bowled with a lot of heart. Is there room for improvement? Sure. But he can improve a lot.

And his batting is something he doesn't get a lot of credit for. He's a better batsmen that he get credit for. When I saw his fifty, I was convinced that he is a good no. 6 in any team. That's all I can say for him."

If SKY or Ishan starts opening and QDK gets out of form then even Turner is a great option to have, we have send Hardik up the order, Turner is well known finisher in BBL, felt it was just bad luck for him in RR.

comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,Exactly this. If you’d properly watched the previous season he used to bowl good for three-ish overs and then fuck it up in the fourth either by own mistakes or by being unlucky which resulted in ruined stats.

Don't agree with Pollard point cause I think he performs in crunch situation and did well enough for me last year. We had a chance to release Krunal this year and get someone like Morris in auction who could bat as well as Krunal if not better and bowl as well as Malinga at this age and get a gun opener like Roy because after releasing Krunal we could easily afford him or trade him for Kane or even just releasing him can give us chance to get Starc, we would hardly miss his batting and bowling wise we could get better spinner than him. Our team combination would have so much better. I think this is Krunal's last chance if he doesn't perform this year with his batting, it might be his last IPL for MI, no way we can retain him next year cause he is capped player, Krunal bowling is more suited for CSK pitch."

comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"I think it's because Curran gets absolutely murdered on roads because of his bowling style relying more on swing than others, which is why his stats aren't too good and therefore why people don't rate him as much in the IPL. He's young, and for him to have a memorable IPL first up is something worth considering. I think that KXIP should've persisted with him so that he could settle into the team more, but oh well"
comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"**warning**: huge text of wall. Sorry bro.

Okay. First he's neither an opening strike bowler nor is he a death bowler because he is an all-rounder. The player I can compare him with bowling wise is Stokes or Pandya, and both of them are not good opening or death bowler in IPL. So let's see

1. First match. Doesn't bat. Opens the bowling against Butler. Any other bowler can be murdered against butler and we wouldn't think much, so in his first IPL match, in his first time in India, Butler slaughter him. Even then, in his last over (17th in innings) bowls a 4 run over. Not good first performance, but can be excused.

2. 2nd 3rd match did not play. 4th match scores a 10 ball 20 and takes 4 wickets. So don't need to get into it. Point for him.

3. 5th match was bad bowling wise, and only bat for one ball. So yeah bad match. Point taken from him.

4. 6th match bowls 4 overs for 30 and apart from Rajpoot, was joint economical. Batting wise came when 11 were needed from 6 with Rahul on other end. Scores 5 from 3 and gave back strike to Rahul. So a win for Sam Curran, I think.

5. On a Wankhede paradise pitch, gave 54 runs in 4 overs. Bad bad bad I know. But honestly, Ashwin playing him as 5th bowler, when he bowls at 130kmph, on a non 'patta' pitch, was a bad bad bad decision, imo. I would not take point away from him in this match.

6. 8th match was bad. Point taken from him.

7. 9th match did not play. 10th match got out early, so bad batting wise. Bowling wise, ashwin bowled him 2nd over. Gave 15 runs in his 2nd and 3rd over which I personally think is good for a sixth bowler. But take a point away from him.

8. 11th 12th match did not play. 13th match played a 25 balls 55 innings and bowled first 3 overs for 22 runs and took to cleaners in the last over. So I will give a win to him. If he was the sixth option only, he would be a good bowler.

9. 14th match 4 overs 35 runs 3 wickets. Scored 6 runs off 7 balls. Clearly a win for him.

So to tally, according to my opinion, 4 points to him and 3 against him. And again, if he was used as a no. 6 batter and 6th bowler, he would be a perfect all-rounder. In his first time in India, in his first time in IPL, playing as a complete bowler when he bowls only at 130kmph, when he was bought at pressure inducing 7 crores, **in my opinion** he did extremely good. Compare him to Stokes, who scored 123 runs at 20 average and 6 wickets at 31 average, when Stokes is considered as a proper batsman and a genuine 5th bowler. Sam Curran was very good, and didn't deserve to be dropped."
comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"I'm not too opposed to Aaron Finch, he'll do well at the Chinnaswamy, but imo they should heavily invest in Starc or Cummins, I'm tired of watching them make 200 and have the opposition by the balls only for their legendary death bowlers to show up, like they did both matches Vs KKR last year."
comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"Yeah true, I personally think he will contribute alot more batting wise in the future and will excell as a handy bat to tonk a few useful runs."
comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"Motabhai, iss saal let us win IPL naa. Odd years are off course yours, futile to even compete in those."
comment,IPL 2020 Player retentions [ Megathread],164,"I'll start this off by saying that I'm only going to respond to stuff I did not agree with, so if I left something out, it was because I agreed.

Even then, in his last over (17th in innings) bowls a 4 run over. Not good first performance, but can be excused.

Why does he get a pass here? Now sure, it was his debut match, but there was a reason he was getting paid so much money and was in the side as an overseas player, it was because he was supposedly good enough to take on the best and succeed against them. If he couldn't do that then why did KXIP pick him?

>On a Wankhede paradise pitch, gave 54 runs in 4 overs. Bad bad bad I know. But honestly, Ashwin playing him as 5th bowler, when he bowls at 130kmph, on a non 'patta' pitch, was a bad bad bad decision, imo. I would not take point away from him in this match.

Nah, he deserves some flack here as well, sure it wasn't a great decision to play him as a 5th bowler, but his performance was trash. If he is being paid in a similar category as Andre Russell, then surely his performance should resemble Russell's performance at least to an extent. The point is he isn't good enough to bowl unless the conditions are assistive, nor is he good enough to make it as a batsman. 

Russell, Pandya, and Stokes will all walk into their respective teams as batsmen alone, but they can also do well with the ball because they have the ability to bowl in the 140s, and to bowl change-ups at different lengths, which is why they're successful, Curran, on the other hand, cannot do either. 

> Compare him to Stokes, who scored 123 runs at 20 average and 6 wickets at 31 average, when Stokes is considered as a proper batsman and a genuine 5th bowler. Sam Curran was very good, and didn't deserve to be dropped. 

See here's the thing, this was Ben Stokes' worst year ever as a cricketer, he showed what he can do at the WC and Ashes, he can be a match-winner with both bat and ball. Compare that to Curran who's too inconsistent to make it as a pure batsman and not good enough to make it as a bowler. His bowling is akin to Stonis', yet his batting is nowhere nearly as good."

If KL or Maxwell hung around with Pooran, I reckon he'd get a 100 and they'd have a chance at winning. 

Also, at the end I was confused by Pooran's strategy, he seemed like he was gonna see Rashid last over out safely, turning down singles. Then he suddenly decides to play a ball with only 2 left and gets a soft dismissal :("
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Before I say anything else, I wanna say as a kxip fan for 13 years now, I have only 5 words, ""they don't deserve to win"".

Last match Mandeep played a brilliant counter attacking 27 off 16, how do you reward that? By playing him at 6. You wanna drop an in form Pooran for out of form Maxwell? Guess what he scored a brilliant 50. Sarfaraz got 3 chances and he scored 12(12) on a difficult chase, scored 7(8) when whole team failed, and scored 14(9) when the situation demanded. You dropped him for no reason. So Fuck you KXIP, you don't deserve to win. You deserve to be at the bottom. Fuck. You."

We absolutely need a 7th batsman I understand batdeep didn't work one match but now with a horrible bowling lineup you try to be even worse? Neesham needs to come in.

Maxwell is finished and Gayle should take his place.

If Rahul is still captain next season our franchise should just dissolve.

Gayle, Mayank, Rahul, Mandeep, Pooran, Neesham, Hooda, Gowtham, Bishnoi, arshdeep, shami

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"The problem with KL Rahul is, he wants to try and experiment everything once and not one thing more times. You can do it in your first three matches and in best cases, in nets. But, not at the mid way of league phase in tournament.

The moment I saw that new guy coming one down, I sensed utter stupidity and felt like that one down person is one of those hormone filled player in your local team who wants to be a hero and jacks up the momentum completely.

Maxxi or Mandeep would have been awesome choice to send at # 3 today. Both these need 10 balls to face and you have ""set"" players on the crease.

Bottom line is, KXIP's management is totally fucked up."

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Like I said in last match, KL should reanalyze his batting strategy. He is playing too slowly and it's not like he is struggling to time the ball like Warner or someone else. It seems deliberate as if he took on the responsibility to bat through the innings and thereby consolidating his spot in national team. It came off in RCB match because of Kohli dropping a couple of dollies but not a sustainable plan in long term. 

Considering Rohit's propensity to accelerate after a slow start, India can't afford three accumulators in the top 3 for 2020 world cup. I know Intent^(TM)  is an overused word but Rahul needs to show intent if he wants to open with Rohit."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Bishnoi and Arshdeep did a brilliant job of pulling things back when SRH were looking set for 220+. They came to bowl in a difficult situation and still aced it so props to them.

Let someone else get a long rope now.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"I heard Kumble, the head coach of KXIP, saying in an interview with commentators that Gayle was about to play today's match. He didn't play because he was not well. So, in the next match you might see Gayle in for Maxwell. That would disturb the good opening partnership of Mayank and Rahul but it is worth doing. If given a longer rope the way they do with Maxwell, Gayle will definitely fire in few matches like Watson is doing now for CSK."

KL and Mayank have had a few great games, Pooran has been good in past couple of games, Bishnoi has impressed, Shami has generally got wickets and Cottrell's stats are ok minus that Tewatia over. 

But 1 or 2 players performing a day do not win the team games. Look at MI and DC at the top of the table, they always have many players performing. Even when someone gets 70 or 80, there are others playing a supporting role and the bowlers turning up."

This is exactly what is said in the match thread. Couple of guys responded saying he has been assigned the role of anchor . 
He is just being selfish. That run out of Mayank highlighted it. He is just trying to get the highest score for his team every game.

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,A lot of planning needs to go into creating a successful team . Can’t just turn up and show results rightaway. By the time he settles down he and kl will be removed and a new captain / coach will be installed . Rinse and repeat . Story of kings 11
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Sam Curran is doing bits at CSK. Bowling very well and hitting some 17/18s in 5-6 balls every game. 

Morgan has been handy for KKR. Incorrectly used but done alright in a couple of really solid knocks. 

Buttler has been okay and just played a mental innings. 

Joffra’s doing well and bowling great

Tom Curran has disappointed but stokes is coming in soon 

Jordan has been ass so far. 

YJB’s played 3-4 good innings so far!

Ali’s just had one game so far. Got a wicket in 2 overs but didn’t do shit with the bat."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Surely this has to be more. I mean they didn’t get a wicket till over 16. Surely CSK took more than 12 overs in their chase and made more than 147.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"No need to troll anyone. Criticism is fine, but trolling always gets out of hand and leaves a bad taste for everyone.

No player underperforms willingly under normal circumstances. It's ultimately the management's call to drop him, he's not gonna say no to playing a match."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Maxwell is a gun T20I player and has been very consistent in international T20s so my guess is the that is the only reason he's still there. It's funny though how he's failing to fire in the format that  he's dominating in international levels with better bowlers

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Maxwell was top 3 ipl players for one season and then we didn't see that Maxwell again.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Except Kedar Jadhav has also scored an 100 with a strike rate of 150 against the very opposition Maxwell played against last month.

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Tbh I respect csk for that, its not a coincidence they perform so well without having a really good team like mi. They back their players, sometimes it backfires but most of the times it works."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"It really irritates me when teams like RR and KXIP chop and change their teams constantly, especially indian youngsters.

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Punjab got Morgan in 2017. He didn't deliver that season. Also he's been unsold for 2018 and 2019 seasons. Him getting sold last auction was actually a bit of a surprise.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Hey, I'll still support this shitty team, but really this team doesn't deserve to win over teams who support their players and are genuinely trying."

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Most overrated player ever in IPL. People think he is some 150 SR players when he can't put his bat on to the ball to save his life.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"He’s still living off that one innings he played for RR 6-7 years ago. We even used our RTM on him in the 2018 auction hoping he would finally click. Thing is, there are no good Indian middle order batsmen who can hit and the guys who even show the slightest amount of promise are given a long rope hoping they would turn around their career at some point."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Literally only 4 games.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"He averaged 34 in that season too, so he was only great during those 6 matches i guess."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,They can get destroyed by a better batting line ups though. Even today they still had 2 overs left and Pooran would have backed himself to get 40 off 12 from those 2 overs if  he didn't throw his wicket away. Warner was clearly hiding their overs and hoping Pooran gets out before he brings those 2 back which is what exactly happened.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,He needs more variations other than yorkers  and if he can bring some mind play too we can definitely see him in Indian squad soon.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Not really, they had 6 wins under their belt from the first seven matches in 2018 and they still shit the bed."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"I mean, they did win the very next match, anyway an ineffective bowling unit, a non existent middle+ lower order is going to remain unaffected by atmosphere imo"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"He had similar incident against rajasthan last year when he started hitting way too late and they ended up losing the match. Great innings and his teammates not performing on the other end was also a big reason but when you are there since the first ball, you should be the one leading attack in 15th over."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"He is too good for that.

Iirc, Gayle did demolish Rashid one match. But that's an exception. Even today , nariane is still respected.
It's gamble which may or may not work.

Also he is not tricky bowler like Mendis or naraine . He is traditional bowler but very talented like chahal."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,He's hard to pick. He's too fast to pick from his action since it's quick and he bowls quite fast as well. Teams will get better though it'll probably take a few more seasons. Narine took a few years before he turned less lethal.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Too risky taking him on. Very few succeeded and taking him on in 2nd innings is next to impossible. Dude gets a boner while bowling in 2nd innings.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,He isn’t like them though. There’s no mystery to his bowling except that he bowls faster and shorter than a traditional leg spinner which removes the option of coming down the wicket against him. The only players whom I’ve seen take him on are those who can sweep very well and have a really good slog sweep in their arsenal. Too bad most players can’t play it very well.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Dude has a confusing action, bowls in 90s, picks great lengths and the field placement is often pretty good. Taking risks against him is just foolishness lmao"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,">ownership

So, we are blaming ownership for this otherwise it is all Kohli's fault in RCB.

>Kohli just had to throw a hissy fit when he didn’t get a yes man

Only for the fact that there were many players who had issues with Kumble. And all this Kumble hype is dogshit, now we know.

Also If you think Shastri is a yes man, you are either 16 or memes are your primary source of knowledge."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Watched it... I was thinking I was stupid to guess it was that person who was blowing heads. Eventually that turned out to be the twist. Fucking diabolical. Have to wait for 3rd season

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Garg was sensational in the field, Samad has been underwhelming everywhere (intent but no execution). Bring in 3D Shankar for Samad"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Garg should be persisted with. He got a duck only because he started selflessly hitting out first ball in the penultimate over. 

Samad is not bringing enough at this point IMO."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,2018 Delhi team didn't had Dhawan Ashwin Rabada Nortje. That team barely had any experience. You can't really compare that team to current team.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Kumble was extensively involved in the auction process too so it's not like he was brought in after the team was selected. And considering the performance this year can you really blame the management if they sack him? The first three matches they showed promise but since then they never have looked like being in the game.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,36.3 overs from getting Rohit Sharma the other day to getting Warner yesterday.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Damn...i just realised that this could be his last ipl. Now Kxip has to play him or I'll start a revolt for my boy.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Yeah, but some teams just like the cushion of having an extra bowling option. Given what happened to SRH's fifth bowlers this match, I see the rationale in it.

Of course, the issue is Maxwell has not been contributing at all with the bat. So even if his bowling was being used more regularly, it wouldn't be of much use."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,I think someone on Dugout mentioned how Maxi has less pressure in the Aus team since there's other match winners ahead of him. Whereas in the IPL he's paid a huge sum and one of the 4 overseas spots so he feels the need to perform. Could be a mindset thing.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Yet for some odd reason looks like a Tailender whenever he gets out. His shot selection sometimes has been beyond atrocious this season.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Smith opening isn't working out. Really. I get that he wants to protect Samson, in a way but Samson is a great opening batsman.

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"DD was coming from a big win over Gujarat lions and some of my friends got excited and expected the match to go same way. I predicted pant would get out in 3 balls he faces from Bumrah. He got out on 2nd.

What a roller coaster that ipl was, from out of nowhere we chase down 209 in 17.3 overs and get bundled for 66 in the next match. Peak Delhi."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"I didn't see the interview, but the commentators were mentioning it. They said that Kumble said that they were going to play Gayle, but he had Food Poisoning so they played Pooran."

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Yeah, India picked him way late but dude has one of the best List A records of all time. Let’s stop pretending he’s a complete mug (he’s just a complete mug right now)"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,That was 2017. And clearly Jadhav is not the same player.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Well he does have 6 IPL fifties and a more than decent strike rate. He's also a live wire in the field. But I do concede that the ""flashes of brilliance"" have become almost non existent these days with bat and ball in hand."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Not only thr ownership but the whole management changed. We brought in the most Successful Captain of all time as our coach and damn he's making some great plans.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"This theory is valid for the experienced/ match winners. I've believed that backing players is the best way to win tournaments and CSK have done that time and time again. Kedar Jadhav is a good ODI player, but he isn't someone like a Watson who is going to win you games single handedly. With a SR of less than 100 and an average of 20 for csk, I think they're instilling too much faith in him."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"I really hope they don't drop Prabhsimran and Arshdeep in the next game, but I get the feeling that they will."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Yeah, I just looked at his stats the other day and was like what the fuck? He isn’t even a good striker in the domestic level ffs"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"True, he had an incredible start but his form fell away towards the end. In his last 6 innings that season, he made only 35 runs."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Nah. Keep backing Samad but more for his batting than his bowling. Maybe replace Garg with 3D if you really want extra bowling but 3D would’ve gotten smacked by Pooran too - his trundle only works in specific conditions and against specific batsmen
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Narine also had to change his action , after that he's nowhere near a threat be used to be.
He still bowls well but that wicket taking ability is not there."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Narine became less lethal with his action change. Don’t think they could pick him up even after that. Just that the sharpness was gone.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,And he has like 4 wronguns or something crazy like that
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Kohli’s been a constant at RCB, my man. So read my comment and try again.

And Shastri’s been a BCCI lapdog for decades. If you don’t know this, maybe you ought to check your sources. 

As for many players hating Kumble, that’s possibly a fair point but we won’t know one way or another outside of rumors or hearsay until these guys have retired. For now, all we have is the public record and that establishes that Kohli didn’t like Kumble while a few other players have been non-committal either way when asked."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Samad is still only 18, he has a lot of room to grow and learn. I say keep him on and let him get experience so he can develop throughout the season."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"We still had useful looking guys like Shami, Morris, Boult, Munro etc. There was a mix of older players and young players, and we still underperformed.

Our team last year didnt have Ashwin or Nortje either and we finished 3rd"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Yes but the same can be said of other captain coach combos too. Better to stick to one combo for 2-3 seasons and the results will come . Most of the successful franchises have done that .
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Well he said he wants to play till 45. Idk if teams will pick him, but he'll be back next year if someone wants him."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"No, they didn’t bid for him because of the faulty assumption that Englishmen can’t play spin.

comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"What has past coaches and captain has anything to do with what is happening in this season?

Kumble was alone in the auction, he picked the team and he is running the team(in the ground). Rest is made up excuses. lol

Ravi Shastri is lapdog of BCCI:-

"" In 1989, he was one of six senior cricketers who took the BCCI to court after the board banned them for participating in a masala series in North America. ""

"" In Indian cricket, where senior v junior was a big deal, we heard he was never afraid to speak up in team meetings, even as a teenager. Naturally, as his stature grew, so did his forthrightness.""

"" You went to him when a comment was needed on anything prickly, because no one else would talk. No matter how dangerous or stupid the question, you rarely got, ""No comment."" You either got a quotable opinion or useful nuggets. ""

"" During the 2002 tour of England, Shastri championed the Indian players' commercial rights on air. A dispute over pressure being exerted on the team to sign the ICC player agreements for the 2002 Champions Trophy - which gave the ICC sponsors' commercial rights precedence over those of players' individual sponsors - became a three-way tussle between the ICC, the BCCI (aka its president Jagmohan Dalmiya) and the senior players. In the middle of the melee, Shastri said, on air, words to the effect of, ""Mr Dalmiya, this is for you, if you are listening,"" and explained the players' stance. No surprise that in November that year, in the third attempt to set up an Indian players' association, Shastri was centre of the head table during the launch press conference in Calcutta.""

This is excerpts from Sharda Ugra who has followed Indian cricket all her life. Shastri sure looks like BCCI's lapdog and a Yes man.

Never take memes seriously."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Except we can’t keep getting away with his bowling. We physically NEED Shankar, and Samad has not looked too promising, whereas Abishek/Garg have generally looked better. We’re not going to make playoffs by giving these players experience, we need a team that’ll win. I’m all for giving newbies a chance, but they also gotta perform. Natarajan was on the bench for 3 years and look at him now. I’m sure Samad will improve a lot if SRH don’t let him go"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"which was right too IMO. While Kane was in a few overs before him and did not get the strike too much. (He faced 6 balls by end of 19th)

And he he got the runs. SRH lost 5 quick wickets in their bid to get to 230. By the 18th over 200 seemed unreachable."
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"True, Delhi also bombed in 2018 under Ricky ponting but instead of firing him, they retained him and now he is showing why he is the genius mastermind that won Australia several world cups. But I doubt anil kumble deserves a longer rope."

I want to note that i’m not advocating for VS - I’d prefer the same team. Only pointing out that adding Shankar doesn’t really help out bowling and adds another accumulator when what we need is a middle order power hitter so if you really want the extra bowling support, you’re better off swapping ascumulators"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"I think that’s a good point. KXIP have had how many captains in the last 5 or 6 seasons? Off the top of my head there’s Bailey, Ashwin, Maxwell, Rahul, Miller too IIRC."

Shastri has been on Bcci’s payroll as a commentator for at least a decade before he became coach. But please go ahead and bring up shit from when cricket was essentially an amateur sport - you obviously won’t find anything recent cause there isn’t anything recent. 

FYI, for all I know, Kumble may very well be an awful coach - he’s had six games of poor results in the IPL and an incredible season with a great Indian team. Point is that neither are enough. Look for long term patterns instead of being an apologist for people in power and the main long term pattern is that Kohli has made bone headed captaincy decisions season over season with every team he’s been on"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,You bring up a good point but I've lost faith in Shankar after last season and how he started this season. He has a lot of talent but it doesn't show when he plays for Sunrisers. I'd rather stick with Samad than go for Shankar. At least Samad tries to hit.
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,Yeah kumble seems to be a less hands on coach . Looks like more of a strategical mentor. I think he was a mentor earlier for rcb and even MI.

Kohli isn't brightest captain neither is Kumble a good coach.

My comment was mocking idiots who were abusing Kohli for kicking out Kumble cause Kumble is bad man manager and a hothead.

According to Kumble fanatics, India would have won world cup, test series in England and SA if he would have been coach.

(Btw, Mega auction of 2021 is going to be [postponed](https://cricketaddictor.com/cricket/mega-auction-before-ipl-2021-set-to-be-postponed-report/))"
comment,[Post Match Thread] | SRH VS KXIP | IPL 2020,155,"Yeah he hits sometimes but I've not really seen him middle the ball much. He almost always gets out trying to play a shot and edging it. Srh didn't buy him in the auction though, he was part of the deal with DC for Dhawan"
post,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,N/A
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I'm so curious about the experience of less redness after the gym, after I work out I get an embarrassingly red face with a super pale white ring around my mouth and I'd love to not get that anymore haha"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I have under eye lines that keep getting worse. Was wondering what to use and will ask about Belotero! Thank you!!
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"First, you look amazing! 

Second – would you mind sharing more about the masseter Botox? I’m realizing lately that even with a night guard, jaw grinding and clenching is causing soooo much pain during the days… How do you find the pain/side effects etc? "
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Out of curiosity, what made you get lip fillers? You look like you have nice full lips already. Was it just to have them bigger, or did it have some extra benefit (skin more taught around the mouth / laugher lines?)."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"You can definitely tell the difference! Your skin looks flawless! I have been wanting to try Botox but I'm a bit reluctant about the possibility of it not working out. But I see so many women who have positive results. I'm 46, and have been using moisturizer on my face since I was 13. But I have started to notice crows feet, and lines on my forehead and the 11 between my eyes. I'm glad I saw your post. Just love the results you're getting!"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"These are great results thanks for sharing with us. This is also pretty minimal and conservative imo. I saw a few people on here being petty, it feels like there’s some salty people hanging around these parts. You look amazing."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,You look amazing and I’m definitely going to check out IPL. If you liked the RF microneedling see if you can do it with nitrous oxide! I found Morpheus8 so uncomfortable without it that I wasn’t sure I could finish my package but it was a lot better with the addition of NO.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"you are a QUEEN for posting the full routine. You look so refreshed, honestly the spitting image of work well done"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Your cheeks look so much fuller and sculpted! Did you get filler there as well or make any diet/exercise changes?
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"""skin care"" 

>Continues to list 4 different medical procedures

Lol"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Thank you for such a great layout of everything you’ve had done. You look so great, your skin is gorgeous!"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I'm genuinely not trying to be an asshole... can someone point out what I'm supposed to be seeing? OP looks exactly the same in these two pictures other than different hair and lighting? I get that 4 years have gone by but 27 and 31 aren't really that much different in age. I just want to understand what everyone is so shocked about! I don't disagree that OP looks great!
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,So I’m considering getting under eye fillers and have never had any injectables. Does it hurt since under eye skin is very thin?
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,This is the kind of detailed information we want and need! I’ve also had some success with IPL for redness. I’ve only had two treatments and I can see that it’s faded but it’s disappointing/expensive to have to go back for more in the same areas. But you’ve convinced me that I should get at least one more treatment for best results!
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I’m really, really interested in under eye filler. I’m 30 and I’ve been doing botox for 2 years and I love it. It’s expensive, but there’s no going back 😭"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"You seem to have a ton of experience - I have a few questions.  I’m a 33 year old male and I’m getting IPL in 3 weeks but I’m not sure it’s the actual best treatment for me….every single medispa I go to never tells me what I need for my skin, they try to sell the more expensive stuff and say things like “it’s just the best” or kind of sell it like it’s a menu I order off of…

I am considering a tha peel after the IPL but wondering if you had any ideas for me :)"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,The before photo you're raising your eyebrows. I'm curious to see a photo where you are not to see the real difference.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Have you try PRP (placelet rich plasma) injection or adding that to your RF treatment. To be honest I don't know when you did Profound but that one is usually only recommended to more mature patients, usually someone mid/late 30s or above. If you had them under 30s it's a no no. All RF treatment gonna hurt like a b*tch though but they're getting better, those older ones from like 8-10 years ago hurt even more. I remembered getting Infini RF and it hurt like a b*tch. Tears were running down my eyes during treatment but I had to tell myself ""beauty is pain"" everytime haha. I tried Fractora RF treatment in the past and I really like this one but most med spa switch to using Morpheus8 now. It's from the same manufacturer, they have great machines. Also have you try Halo laser before. You should look up a med spa in your area and get 1 of the Halo laser treatment done. You'll thank me later. This one is 10x better than getting IPL done. I mean it's expensive so I don't know if you can buy a package of 3 but if you have the budget for it I'd highly recommended getting the package because Halo laser is amazing. Just Google it or watch some YouTube to learn more about this treatment. I also love Picosure laser a lot it's amazing if someone concern with malasma or dark spots/hyperpigmentations. I used to get Pixel RF and Fraxel done pretty often, omg they both hurts but my skin looks great afterwards so I sucked it up and did it lmao. I love Fraxel a lot, but Halo is supposedly a better version of Fraxel because Halo is the one and only ""hybrid laser"" on the market. It can treat both superficial layer as as as deep under the skin so it was very popular when it first launched way back in 2016 ish (if I remembered correctly). They charge like 1,500 per session, the cheapest I've seen was 1,200. Honestly med spa always charge an arm and a leg for these RF or good laser treatments haha"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Unrelated but at age 31 you are spending how much on these treatments? This expense is only going to go up as you really age. Yes, 31 is not old by any means."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Come back when you hit mid 40’s and late 60’s
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Did you find the Belotero filler helped primarily with lines? Or did it help with darkness as well? Currently deciding between non surgical and surgical options for my under eyes so I’d love to hear your experience.

By the way, you look incredible!!!"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"So masseter botox is only twice per year, and one application holds for 6 months??"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,The eye thing you did was massive improvement. 5 years off on account of that alone.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Alto skin better is a vitamin c serum right? Is there a reason you're also using it at night before retinol? I thought vitamin c and retinoids were contraindicated and shouldn't be used at the same time (but c in the morning and retinoid at night is fine).
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I had one rf microneedling and I will not ever do it again. You can smell the burnt.. dermis? I guess it’s the dermis layer. Idk but I could smell it the next couple days and it made me wanna throw up. And it was very painful. When she started on my forehead I was like “this isn’t nearly as bad as they made it sound.” Then she kept going and it truly only got worse. Then the neck.. I bout nearly jolted every zap.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"For the masseters do you get 50 units total, 25 on each side?  I’m a grinder too and also carry so much tension around my mouth jaw area."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,You have a stacked line up for products! Well done! Those products are phenomenal. Definitely expensive but worth it
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I’m starting IPL soon and this has me soooo excited. Kinda sad to lose my freckles but they haven’t aged well and just look mucky now that I have discoloration.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I’ve had 3 microneedlings with skin pen so no RF and after the first, I said no more because the pain even with the topical numbing and I didn’t feel like I saw results. After the 2nd two, I finally saw results and would do it again."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Do you have any recs on how to find a good esthetician for fillers/injections? My forehead lines are not as deep as your before picture and the first time I tried Botox, they gave me somewhere around 150 units. It seemed like overkill at the time but it was my first time and I didn’t want to question it too much."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Would you say you noticed a big difference using the Skinbetter Alto advanced and Skinbetter AlphaRet?
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,you’re skin is amazing!! also i would never look at the before picture and think you need under eye filler but the difference is huge. i’ve been dying to get under eye filler for years because i have very obvious hallows/volume loss and i only haven’t because of $$$. but seeing how big of a difference is made for you makes me think i should start saving lol
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"can you please add commas to your daily routine products, it's all one line and impossible to distinguish"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I’m thinking - boob Job, lip filler, Botox, maybe some laser treatments and a lot of otc moisturizers and serums."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Damn no doubt that forehead alone needs 50 units.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I know this is for showing your skin routine. But you’ve gotten insanely hotter too 🙏🏻.  Shout out to you
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I don't know why I feel the need to make this comment but I focused on the wrong thing in the first photo.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Wait you can get a treatment for this!? I am always SO embarrassed!!! I get so red with white rings around my eyes and mouth 😩
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"yeah im curious about this too. I blush alot as well, and im wondering if they are related. im going to try propranolol for blushing and im going to report on reddit if it helps for workout flushing."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"OP had an IPL laser, but I have gone to the dermatologist and received VPL laser treatment which was covered by insurance for rosacea 😊"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I recently learned this is a histamine response that causes more blood to come to the surface of the skin. Some people have more active histamine responses on their skin so they tend to turn redder at the gym. An anti-histamine can help BUT there’s at least one study that shows you don’t get as much benefit from the workout with the anti-histamine. I am a fellow gym tomato and recently tried the anti-histamine despite the trade off. It was amazing. I was probably only 30% less red (the anti histamine pill was slightly expired), but I was so much less hot. My workout was so much easier."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Prescription 15% Azelaic Acid has really helped with my redness! I also used to get so embarrassingly red when working out or when I got hot and now I rly don’t have that issue! I actually kind of forgot about it😭 and it was completely covered by insurance! 🤗
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"It was mentioned to me recently by a friend and then by a MedSpa PA that I have rosacea. It's because, while yes, it's expected to be more red after a workout or in hot weather, I turn lobster red. I've been outside with friends and noted the difference. They look flushed, a bit red, and I'm bright red like ppl asking me if I'm alright red. I've booked an appointment with a derm, but my friend who has rosacea said that she is prescribed a topical treatment that you put on every day to help calm it down. The lasers are a longer-lasting solution - at least six months. Saves you from having to put on the topical every day. The folks at the MedSpa said that the laser would not be covered by insurance, but who knows? It probably varies by state and plan. I'll be interested to see what the dermatologist recommends!"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I got Botox in my masseters solely for aesthetic reasons. The decrease in grinding and jaw pain was a very happy side effect. There it’s very little pain in the initial procedure (my injector uses an insulin needle) and I noticed less grinding pain about a week after the procedure when things started kicking in.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"If you speak to a dentist or an OMFS about this they can provide the Botox treatment that is specifically for grinding. It isn’t cosmetic but if you have no relief and don’t want to spend a lifetime taking muscle relaxers this is the way!
I had a dental assistant colleague who went this route and it was life changing for her."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I have it for headaches and jaw pain from clenching at night. The results are amazing! No more headaches or shoulder pain!
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Definitely look into Myofunctional Therapy! I tried botox for my TMJ symptoms for awhile but it wore off pretty quickly. Started doing therapy instead and it's helped reduce my clenching and other symptoms so much!
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,You will get so much relief from masseter Botox. I was waking up sick from grinding my teeth so hard before I had it done. 
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,RIGHT! I had some really nasty people on one of my posts and I just don’t get it. I’m not asking everyone to love how I look but never did I invite people to comment on my personal appearance and tear me down. Like are they just jealous? Miserable? Idk lol
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"There were a shit ton of petty nasty people full of internalized misogyny on an earlier post from a girl that had very tasteful, natural looking lip filler. Can't believe that sort of thing is allowed in a skincare sub with an explicit ""Be Nice"" rule, but here we are. Glad they didn't seem to find this post (for the most part)."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I’ve had no issues with Belotero. I did have to have a second treatment to make them look perfect, but I believe that I truly needed more product. Just make sure that your injector is confident in the procedure. There are some scary things that can go wrong, but I work with my injector and she does several of these every day."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I did Morpheus8 w/nitrice it’s def the way to go!
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Omg I got Morpheus8 on my flanks/lower back… BRUTAL!!! I didn’t know how I would do the rest of my package but I did lol I actually had good results from it but oh man… it was freakin painful
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I hoped someone would mention this. I don’t have cheek filler. It’s because my jaw is slimmer due to masseter Botox. I also have naturally lost some volume. Similar weight in both photos, have always been active."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Kind of hard to see the full effect in this photo, but they were very hollow and are so much smoother now"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Compare OPs forehead in both pictures. She’s is making the same facial expression. In recent picture, her forehead is super smooth with no lines."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Skin texture is improved, hyperpigmentation is improved, skin tone is more even (except for natural freckles) and I’ll bet there are tons of fine lines gone that we just can’t see on a photo. But"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Literally just her forehead is different. Botox in the forehead is all that actually made a difference. Her skin was perfect before
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"What I noticed right away was the unusually smooth forehead, fuller lips, and thinner jawline. It's a popular look right now."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"It was substantially less painful than lip filler. They actually use local anesthetic on the apples of your cheek and use a cannula to reach the under eye. Tiny poke on your cheek is all you’ll feel and everything will be numb. You feel a little pressure, but that’s it. It is kind of scary to see in instruments, but the procedure itself was relatively painless."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Sounds good. Ive been kinda nervous but Your results look amazing and now I can research some better fillers. Thank u!
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,31
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"We will all age. My hope is that my commitment to my skin will help to prevent me from having more invasive procedures as I age. To be completely open, I am a Master Esthetician and have access to most of these laser treatments at a low cost."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,You’re acting like she’s spending your money. This isn’t a very helpful comment unless you were asking about cost in general for personal or curiosity sake.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"If you have undereye hollowness and darkness you need to do PRP injection there, nurse or doctor draw your blood to create platelet rich plasma (PRP), it carries tons of healthy cell and protein so if you injected to undereye, it'll rejuvenate that area a lot and makes your eyes brighter, much better then getting fillers but you might have to do it a few times and might need to combine it with an RF procedure. I love PRP, you can injext that all over the face and it literally will make your face glow and makes you look a few years younger. Fillers for undereyes wise, I used to love getting Restylane Silk because it's the thinnest one in Restylane family so it's great foe undereye and result is super natural"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I used Belotero mostly for hollows under the eye. The filler doesn’t do anything for discoloration, but C&E serums have helped. I do have concealer on in both photos, but the discoloration is so much easier to hide with a little concealer. There was no magic concealing technique that was going to hide the hollows."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I think this is really daily retinol use. RF Microneedling also helped in tightening the skin in my lower face.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Neurotoxins have helped most with (not so) fine lines in conjunction with nightly retinol. 

Tyrosinase inhibitors are a topical product that help with pigmentation. Even by Skin Better Science is my favorite. TCA peels are also an effective treatments for pigmentation or IPL on VL setting."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"That’s a really good question!! IPL can be used at different wavelengths to treat different things. The wavelength I used were to treat hyperpigmentation and redness, but you can totally use IPL for hair removal (though there are more effective options these days)."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I’m not an injector, but that seems like an insane amount of Botox. Did they perhaps use Dysport? I know the units are different. 

Honestly, I’ve been to some not great injectors, but I’ve found one now that I love and am sticking to. I wish I had better advice, but in all honesty, you might have to try 1 or 2 before you find someone perfect for you."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I would always recommend looking at their socials to see the results they post. If you like their aesthetic, then there you go."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"The way I always found a good injector, wherever I was living, was by asking other people. If I saw they had Botox done, and I liked the way they looked, I would just ask for their recommendations.

It was easy for me to ask because I would just be honest. I would start off with, “I love the way your skin looks. Do you get Botox? If so, can you recommend someone for me because I want my skin and botox to look like that.”

We women who love skin care also LOVE to talk about skincare :-)"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I think Alto Advanced is fine and I needed a C&E in my routine. I actually prefer C&E Furlic by Skinmedica and will purchase this again once I’ve run out. AlphaRet on the other hand is my absolute holy grail retinol. I’ve got very sensitive skin and this is the only retinol that I can use regularly with little to no reaction and actually reap all of the awesome benefits of retinol!
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,One syringe of filler is around $650. It would take 4 to fill marionette lines (from nose to mouth) and sagging jaw completely. Very $$$$.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I work in a med spa, so my spendings are significantly less than average. I don’t think that what I’m spending is an accurate representation of the cost of what I’ve had done, so I hesitate to share."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,So you’re saying she aged down 8 years cuz the after is first.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Is this red face during exercise only rosacea? I did see it mentioned when I looked online but I was under the impression you have to have lasting redness for rosacea 
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Not OP but after a few rounds of IPL I noticed I was a lot less red faced in the gym. I definitely still get pink but it's not a bright red circular tomato face anymore lol
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"That's so interesting, thanks for sharing. I will have to look into that more. I've had seasonal allergies all my life but I'm doing immunotherapy treatment, I wonder if there's any link with allergies there, or if my treatment could someone lessen my body's histamine response overall."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Very interesting. Thank you for sharing! I get red from pretty much anything including workouts, alcohol, gluten, heat and lack of sleep!"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I am definitely going to try this.  Did you take a day time non drowsy one, like Claritin? Or did you take Benadryl?"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Ahh I'm actually already using that, it's just been a really long time since I've worked out hard enough to get the super red face haha so I can't say if it's changed"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Do you have the typical red flush that's permanently on the cheeks though? I don't have any other signs of rosacea personally
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"These treatments are the same as the one OP is describing. It’s just Botox to the masseter muscles, and it is both aesthetic and medical (or either depending on the intended purpose). It is often not worth it to go to a dentist or OMFS for this treatment as their pricing is often dramatically higher with no added benefit (and still not covered by insurance). They may have a little more finesse when it comes to number of units, but a well-trained RN or NP can locate the masseters just as well as any dentist; they’re hard to miss."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Hi can I ask if you had to pay out of pocket or if it was covered by insurance somewhat? US obviously
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Oh man, I never even considered how the TMJ might relate to headaches and shoulder/neck stuff – but anatomically makes total sense!! Thank you so much!!"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"You tried it, but you look better without it. Everything else looks great but I think your lips looked better in the before pic."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"What a shame. I enjoy these posts because a person posted their real life experiences and we can all learn a lot and make more informed decisions. Plus, super pumped for her she looks amazing. Dingbats all over the internet I swear."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"They also attract a lot of toxic self-reflection but also narcissistic vanity posts ""Look at my beauty and weep"" 

It's a delicate balance - this one is really before and after so I don't see any problem and she lists what she did.

  
Some have zero regimen zero context just ""Look at MEEEE me so pretty ME ME ME ME"" - this is not that."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,OMG. I just looked at that post. I am disgusted for how you were talked to on there. What’s funny is you posted it to other subs and you had really normal kind responses. Wtf. Your lips look really amazing and I’m not just saying that. Wow. I am disgusted.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,I posted in an eyelash extension sub asking for advice on my first time attempting DIY extensions and had a bunch of people hop in making fun of my lips saying they looked “painful”. People can be really awful on here! We should all be able to do and look how we want. I don’t really get the hate people have when people choose to get cosmetic procedures done.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I would not do it. Just had my fillers dissolved a couple of weeks ago after having them for almost 4 years and no sign of dissolving on their own. The first year I had no issues. Everything looked good. But after that initial year it went downhill. My under eyes would swell up so much it was very noticeable especially when I was laughing and the filler looked so hard and kind of bulged out. and oddly enough you could always see it more in pictures. I hated how I looked and it made me look even more tired and older than before. I didn’t have any migration but the swelling (cause fillers love to draw water) was so bad. My new doctor also told me I was not eligible for under eye filler in the first place (he told me a lot of people actually are not qualified) since I have a slight malar bag on one side of my face, and filler makes those malar bags even worse cause they block your lymphatic system hence even worse swelling/puffiness. so please make sure you talk to someone who’s well-versed in under eye fillers and someone who can also say no if needed to. Right now I’m trying prf filler. Maybe that would also be an alternative for you."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,She is raising her eyebrows in the 2nd pic. I wish she would've posted a before Pic of the forehead without raising her eyebrows.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Oh, thank you. I had assumed she was making a slightly different expression, but now I see what you mean."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Mild acne, comedones, some texture on my forehead, cheeks and temple area. I’m going to attach a photo of my skin if seeing it would help - one thing to mention I had a glycolic peel on Friday so my skins a bit extra red / peeling / sensitive.

comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Except in Australia it’s now illegal for practitioners  to post before and after and also name any treatments. Sooooo frustrating
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"LMAO imagine saying this in r/30PlusSkinCare 

You look absolutely stunning, OP"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"If you mean wrinkles, recent studies have shown botox can actually worsen the appearance of existing wrinkles once the botox wears off, which is why botox typically requires ""upkeep.""


I'm not anti-botox in general, it works for some people, but claiming it's ""preventative"" is misinformation."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"lol I didnt see AM just Daily routine sorry

in my defence we dont really use AM/PM in my language so I kinda forgot"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Yeah I was as surprised as you are! Thought it was a cosmetic procedure but only cost me $40. I guess it depends on how your dermatologist codes the procedure and if you have rosacea it might not be considered cosmetic. Just a guess though!
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,No. A red face after working out is normal. The blood is coming to the surface of your skin because your HR and temp are elevated and blood vessels are dilating to help you cool down.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Nope! Exercise exacerbates it and I will always flush more because of it but the VPL helps it. I will just need to do it indefinitely.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,It’s a setting on an IPL device that is intended to diffuse erythema. IPL can also be used on different settings to treat hyperpigmentation.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,Same here. My face also gets red when I drink one too many glasses of red wine and when the heat is too high during winter.
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Just wanted to follow up to add that I tried a non-expired Zyrtec before working out a few days ago, and I was probably 80-90% less red, and whatever redness I had cleared up super fast. My skin almost looked like my normal color when I was walking out of the gym. It was amazing. Additionally, I didn’t feel like I was dying when I was on the treadmill. It’s like I’ve been running through mud my whole life and now am on dry ground. This is such a game changer."

comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Not a touch up, but a full second treatment. This was always part of the plan. We started with a smaller amount of product to see how it settled and decided on more. It’s really easy to look swollen or overdone and I really wanted natural looking results."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"I would recommend going to see a Dermatologist first.
I can’t see the picture you posted, but from what you described, I would ask your dermatologist about the Clear & Brilliant laser. 
(It also helps to shrink pores, and that might help with the mild acne and the comedones that you mentioned.)


—Just plain “Clear & Brilliant” fraxel laser without the “PermAa” is more geared toward Wrinkled and textured skin AND shrinking Pore Size. . (***Some people get this once a month instead of a facial once a month.)

—“Clear & Brilliant “PERMEA” is the fraxel laser that specializes in eliminating Brown Spots. Geared toward the pigmented skin.

Hope this helps :)"

But I think it actually does the opposite, it just makes good information harder to come by PLUS now if someone has to pay for a consult and then it turns out that practitioner is bad they are less likely to walk away because they have already paid money for that consult.

If it is rosacea, does this mean I can potentially get rid of the excess redness? Should I talk to my dermatologist about it?!"
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"kind of! my skin is both super fair and  translucent. like you can see my veins on my legs, it’s kind of reflective. i’m like shockingly white.  paler complexions in general have less pigment, so our skin is inherently more translucent than complexions with more melanin. i’m the most dramatic version of that, which i personally have only seen comparable reflective/translucence in irish/english type pale people. because we’re see through, you can literally see the blood under our skin when we flush. 

if you have a similar level of translucence to your skin, then you’ll be able to see a normal flush more than the average person. where the flushing is more associated with rosacea is if the redness accompanies heat. like when i get a rosacea flush, my face turns red and my ears turn super red and they’re hot to the touch. if it’s just blushing without the heat, that’s more likely to be regular clear people problems."
comment,4 years consistency and the right treatments,2175,"Thank you so much for this information! There’s a definitely a difference in when I blush and people tell me I look red to the two situations I described above (red wine and indoor heating) where my face feels warm. 

I am fair but I don’t think my skin is as translucent as you mention yours is, but still this is valuable information. I think I will schedule an appointment with my dermatologist to discuss this."

comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Biggest winners of auction is KKR. Got some bargain buys and a full squad that will provide them cover if someone gets injured.

MI and CSK had a settled squad before the auction and only needed backups, they are the favorites.

DC have a great team as well, but if anything happens to Rabada they might be in trouble.

SRH did not strengthen their middle order, that might bite them.

RR went for some value buys and nothing big, time will tell if that pays off. They will have their internationals available for the whole IPL this time.

RCB - not a full squad, but atleast some of the buys like Finch, Morris and Steyn do strengthen the squad. Bowling is still a question mark.

KXIP despite having 16 crore left in the purse and managed to improve their squad quite well and plug in a lot of weaknesses. Highly impressive job by Kumble."

Steyn and Umesh are in form, Siraj and Saini will improve with experience, Chahal is a great wicket taker, Sundar and Dube are international players now and Morris will be raring to prove a point. Great squad tbh"
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,">DC have a great team as well, but if anything happens to Rabada they might be in trouble.

I still don't understand why they let boult go to MI :("
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Bowls at pace, can hit lower down the order, can bowl a good yorker, athletic in the field, and will probably look good in endorsements for the sponsors. I'm surprised it did not go higher."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Fair enough. Both Keemo and Woakes are bowling all rounders. Should have picked a full time fast bowler as a substitute.
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Has he scored 183? If no, then he's not captaincy material."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,For me he's third in order after Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. IPL Captaincy was anyway coming at some period for him. Let's see if he can manage a team without losing his own form.
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Carey would have been perfect. I think they did bid for him but stopped at 2.2Cr.
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Could have gone for Mushfiqur. Ideal to bat at 5. Could have opened with Finch and Paddikal then, but maybe Koach didn't want him."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,SRH didn’t go into the auction looking for too much. They’ve invested in Mitch Marsh and Allen as the hard hitters and Priyam Garg has a lot of potential as a batsman. Virat Singh has been in fabulous form as well.
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Seems one cap in an Aussie jersey is the golden ticket to IPL fortune. Similar here in NZ to our capped All Blacks who command big money overseas. Except the ex AB players are generally all world class and can slot in to any International squad. So yea I actually have no idea either.

Without the dhoni Fleming combo they are bottom 2 Team imo,but dhoni somehow always makes it click."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,What changes do you think for away games?  Maybe remove one of the spinners for an additional overseas pacer ?
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"True. All we needed at auction was a good batsman at 5 and 6.   


Considering the current form, Virat Singh and Priyam Garg are any day better than Hooda and Chacha. Sandeep is a good hard-hitting allrounder."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Lel no. Quality of games will go down drastically if you include 2 more teams.
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"We didn't need those players, we needed middle order players, a couple of Indian players that can play horses for courses, and fast pacers/alrounders

The only loss I feel is Cummins, but really he was top inflated and risky to buy. Really happy with Cottrell and Jordan too, specially if they click"
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Too many openers

Not many proven finishers for end of the innings (Pant is in torrid form. Plus in some of his innings, he is just lucky)

If Rabada is injured, bowling is fucked. (Plus his form is also fucked).

Dada won't be there this time.

Going to be a bottom 4 finish."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Parthiv Patel is wasted at 7, he cannot bat outside the PP"
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"I feel bad for Sundar. In spinning conditions he should replace Umesh. 

I agree Parthiv cannot open this season. When there are two much superior players to him in that position. Moving Padikkal down the order would be a complete waste and Parthiv is only in the team due to his wicket keeping. I don't think it would be acceptable to change the entire team to suit him when especially in the small grounds of Bangalore you have mediocre opener when you could have an explosive batsmen and an up and coming, domestically successful batsmen"
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Why can't ABD keep?? Wasn't he a keeper for a major part of his career? RCB can then get another player to balance the team better
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,5 oversees players?
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Also remember in our first season Parthiv Patel was our opener. We have moved on a lot since then. I think Shankar can be a good finisher at 4 since the openers will do bulk of the work and the number 4 and number 5 will do most of the finishing work so we can put one of the Indian youngsters at 5, Abhishek at 6 and Nabi at 7."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Lmao what? SRH were dog shit in those seasons. They are better off now than back then. Hell im willing to beat SRH will easily finish above every other team except CSK and MI. Last season we almost blew the whole league up but couldn’t because the best batsmen in the league had to leave by Match 10 and 12.
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"On Cricbuzz Live, Joy was saying that teams are expecting to use him as a mystery spinner for one or two must-win matches. Since no one has seen him bowl, they expect him to keep the batsman guessing for a few matches."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"You’re looking too much into it mate. When we needed it, we went for players. Rashid, fizz, Trent Boult etc. were all huge buys when they were got em"
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Not a bad idea at all. Bout has leaked runs a lot in IPL. He failed to defend 14 against Yusuf in the last over vs SRH in 2018. Deadly in suitable conditions but not the best in India. See no harm in trying out Dhawal and playing the additional overseas batsman.
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Lynn is obviously much better and dangerous batsman in T20s than QDK. I say Lynn comes in, Kishan keeps the wicket and QDK is the backup opener"
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"ABD is def not keeping. That leaves parthiv or Josh. Parthiv's strike rate plummets after the powerplay overs. Would prefer if they give Josh a chance along with padikkal.  Dont know much about the other wk Ahmad.

Looking at his current form, Dube before siraj and negi. Having siraj, saini and yadav in the XI just wont work."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Doubt a 35+ year old ABD will be able to keep continuously for such a long tournament. He was always a backup keeper for SA. Dhoni has always been the first choice keeper for India and can hence keep effectively even at 37. Not sure the same can be said about ABD.

comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"IIRC, he's had Dhenier's backing in the past. Plus him being a leg spinner frees up Tahir's overseas slot (like the comment above states) He is also a handy pinch hitter on occasion. I wouldn't be surprised if he is in our starting XI. So leg-spin + a bit of slogging + overseas slot for a fast bowler. That may justify the price tag."

comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"What are you saying? This is an excellent squad!

Rahul is a proven opener in the IPL and how has locked a T20i spot. He is batting very well since the WC and will only improve in form. 

Shami+Cottrell will be excellent in the start, death overs will be an issue. Jordan will have to cover that, idk how he is. 

Pooran is striking the ball very well and had good innings in the last IPL also. With a locked in spot he will only get better.

Maxwell is 50/50.

Gowtham is _on fire_ right now. He could be great spinner and finisher for Kings. 

This is a good squad."

comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Exactly my point. Wouldn’t it have been a better idea to have traded Williamson for some good Indian player after the World Cup? Now we’re stuck with Mitchell Marsh.
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Why have kaul in the 11 ?  he avg 40 last year at 9 an over too,all the hype around him and the big domestic numbers have also started declining (his pace was the mohit-takur category as well  last season).  
Even sandeep was Better  last year though he too like kaul and thampi isn't ideal candidate in most 11 these days. Kaul might still start like last time but don't see him being persisted with afterwards and probably will again be replaced by sandeep.  
Nadeem is sure to be there in the 11 ,while the u19 capt Garg is also likely candidate."
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"Hope so. And Finch, Padikkal, Kohli, AB, Moeen could make an explosive top 5. But after previous seasons, an RCB squad performing like it should on paper will be a pleasant surprise."

comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Isn't really a hit down the order type batsman like some windies bowlers.  Is more like bhuvi as being handy to stick around and frustrate the bowlers and run singles  with just the odd boundary in between . His yorkers are probably not what they used to be either compared to his early years as well.

Two out of Ngidi/Hazlewood/Curran for away and Santner+Tahir for home. If 4 spin 1 pace is too much at home, they could always sub out one of the intl spinners for one of the three intl pace bowlers.

I also wanna give Murali Vijay a shot at opening again because I'm not sure what kind of form any of the openers (esp. Rayudu) are in at the moment. Someone's got to be reliable until Faf and Watto play their mandatory 1 or 2 match-winning performances."

comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,"True. But in this case, they just don't care. When Hyderabad won in 2016 there was hardly any celebration.

In fact Maran got SRH by unfair means when Srini was at the help. Fuck these corrupt crooks!"
comment,Post Match Thread: IPL Player Auction 2020 Discussion,134,Boult is the new ball bowler. Similar to how Behrendroff was used last year. 3 in PP and 1 somewhere in the middle. Malinga/NCN and Bumrah to take care of death overs.

Well if you think like that you're not going to win anything. Steyn's been amazing in MSL. Umesh gets wickets with new ball, just don't bowl him at death. Siraj and Saini have yorkers so they are good options at death. If Dube can learn and improve then he will be handy in the middle with Moeen."

Mandeep too has been misused. He isn't a lower order slogger, he is a stabilizer and could work well as the guy to hold up one end while Rahul/Maxi/Pooran explode at the other end.

Did you watch the last season? Shami was probably the best Indian bowler after Bumrah and Chahar. Ishant did well but was exclusively used as a new ball bowler. Shami was used in all phases and was effective throughout. The rest of the bowling attack let him down. He has also been on fire for about 1.5 years across formats. Shami took 20 odd wickets last year, that's not bad by any stretch.

Cottrell and Jordan are relatively unproven in India but are T20 globetrotters who have been successful almost everywhere they've gone. If used right, this is a pretty well balanced bowling attack."

When it used to be batting friendly with good, consistent bounce and pace, they didn't have the bowlers to make use of it.

Let go of Watson, Jadhav, Vijay, Tahir and Chawla. Dhoni, Rayudu and Bravo can probably last another season but they can’t be relied upon to pull off games on their own. Jadeja, Curran and Santner is a really competent lower-middle order. They have to give youngsters like Gaikwad and Jagadeesan opportunities at the top with Faf guiding them."
comment,"CSK losses the race to IPL 2020 playoffs, first team to be eliminated",427,CSK trolled fans with hat trick of sixes after the game was over.. time to troll us with hat trick of wins lol
comment,"CSK losses the race to IPL 2020 playoffs, first team to be eliminated",427,"No matter what they do , even with this squad it will be tough to screw up more than they did this season. 

Assuming no mega auction , simply bringing back Raina (give him the stupid balcony lol ) and Bhajji will solve lots of problems. We can worry about total rejig once mega auction is confirmed. 

Having said that I see no benefit for carrying on with players like Vijay , Chawla , Jadhav and Watson . We can let go of them and  can bring in relatively younger players and hopefully Dhoni find some SPARK in them to give them more chances like other franchises. Dhoni needs a change in mindset in terms of his batting and captaincy. His obsession with taking chases deep need to stop and someone needs to make him realize him that he is past his prime. I think he has sort of understood that as this season went on. He needs to be more attacking in selection choices. Again he is obsessed with team balance. More attacking options like Tahir needs to be given their due. Imagine giving so many chances to Watson and giving so few to Tahir who was the 2019 purple cap holder. Tahir is now given chances when the season is now long gone. 

I do believe with above changes this team can still make playoffs in 2021 without having to rely on mega auction."

With the absolute gem Curran turning out to be, in addition to chahar and the youngsters that played both this match and the last one. Its the end of one era, but another is just beginning. And if Curran can get half a competent team as dhoni did in 2010, look out ya'll."
comment,"CSK losses the race to IPL 2020 playoffs, first team to be eliminated",427,They kinda knew it. The team had given up a couple of days ago when Dhoni was like “yeah we gonna give other players a go”

Good luck to the rest of the teams. May the best team win!"
comment,"CSK losses the race to IPL 2020 playoffs, first team to be eliminated",427,"CSK barely gave us anything these season. Rightfully at the bottom. I’m so happy that a team like KXIP, who have been so good and also very unlucky, are not below CSK."

comment,"CSK losses the race to IPL 2020 playoffs, first team to be eliminated",427,Looks like KKR have just found their best side with Lockie Ferguson coming on. And with KXIP’s lack of raw pace I think Narine could have a field day with the bat.

If KKR win against KXIP or RR (assuming they lose to CSK), they are on 14.

If RR win against KXIP and KKR, they are on 14.

If KXIP win against KKR and RR (assuming they lose to CSK), they are on 14.

Even if you assume KKR lose all 3 of their games, they'll be on 12 points, same as CSK. If they do lose though it would mean KXIP and RR would also be on 12 points and the winner of the game against each other would be on 14 points."
comment,"CSK losses the race to IPL 2020 playoffs, first team to be eliminated",427,"Csk in its remaining matches can only reach 12 points. So first three teams are already ahead. So no other team should reach 14 points for csk to qualify. But rr,kxip and kkr have 3 games amongst themselves. So that is three wins among them. In any permutation atleast one team will reach 14 points and csk cannot topple them. So it is over. Even ties and resulting points split cannot save them."
comment,"CSK losses the race to IPL 2020 playoffs, first team to be eliminated",427,"RR winning today and the future matches lineup confirms that no team can enter playoffs without having atleast 14 points, i.e. CSK which can get a maximum of only 12 is out.."

We need better openers."

 SRK was caught abusing ground staff on camera, and there's no need to mention what Mallya did. KKR and RCB as a franchise and a team have nothing to do with it."

Didn’t look like that today in the field. It will be hard for him to get a game if Santner and an overseas fast bowler are in the XI. Santner is a better pick overall at the moment."

comment,"CSK losses the race to IPL 2020 playoffs, first team to be eliminated",427,"KXIP has had problems when it comes to crossing over the line few times including bad umpiring decisions, else they would have easily been in top 2. Mayank, Gayle, Rahul and pooran are hitting it beautifully. If they had an impact player in place of Maxwell, then they would have been unbeatable. Bowling is spot on with Shami nailing those yorkers match after match in death overs. If they don't make it then I will be very disappointed. 

RR had disadvantage starting their campaign by playing in Sharjah, which I think played a major factor. Samson and Smith are still not out of their Sharjah hangover and are getting repeatedly out while attempting for a six. Star batsmen ben stokes joined late, however they are now a very formiddable force as almost everything in place now. Better late than never."

post,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,N/A
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,According to many CSK players. The team management who are into cricket for more than 50 years knows how to handle the players psychologically.
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"I personally think with all-rounders like Watson, Dubey, Moeen Ali they make them bat up. They made Watson an opener, Dubey & moeen Ali bat on 3rd position and pretty much made them a  one dimensional player, Watson rarely bowled any overs for CSK and same goes for Dube."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"nothing different in Watson's case, he was playing out of position(as a finisher all rounder) in RCB which was so far off his usual position hence he failed"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"CSK gave the players a long run, players have the assurance. RCB is full of insecurity and their internal management revolves around 2 or 3 players."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"CSK did nothing different. It was RCB who asked him to change his style in that stage of his career by making him bat in lower order as a finisher. It's common case with aging players that they need to spend more time at crease before they can start smashing. I remember Watto taking 11 balls to open his account while opening with CSK. That was against SRH in Final. He went on to hit a century & CSK won. Against same opponent in Final,RCB used him as death bowler & pinch hitter & he failed. Right people for right job matters."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"CSK believes in other players too unlike RCB that revolves around 1 guy all the time. QDK, BAZ, Moeen Ali, Hetmyer, Stoinis, Dube all played for RCB in 2018/19 and yet none of them could contribute because of sending them lower in the batting order and also management not showing much confidence in them. Whereas CSK knows how to utilise players, watch out for Rahul Tripathi and Deepak Hooda this year."

comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Role definition and stability. Watto was hired only and only for his batting capabilities despite him being one of the topmost all rounders of his time because they saw more value in his batting.

comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,In Watson case Bro blame starc and dan not RCB management. He was out of position and ffs he was our death bowler. The second season was horrible many injuries and no captain for few games . But still grateful for his 2016 season. 
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Rcb wanted Watson's bowling than batting. Which made him also shift his focus to getting better at bowling in rcb. Csk made him a complete batter with no need of him focusing on bowling. 

Rcb surely wasted Watson's key potential by making him a bowler but can't complain because Watson was the 2nd highest wicket taker in 2016 season( season which rcb got into finals). Both teams used Watson for different purposes."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"As the players have said it in many public forums - team atmosphere is good regardless of results, benched players are guided and players know their roles within the team.

comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,if you observe all the batters mentioned were batting either as opener or no3. so they faced more balls and scored more
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"For bowlers I guess they use this guy Eric Simmons, if I am not wrong he helps bowlers on getting some swing on the ball maybe for Chahar who has natural swing but still some bowlers like Akash Singh Tushar Mukesh got some swing when played with him."

comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"I think what CSK does well is role definition. If Moeen is their spin hitter, he will come in when Spin is in play. If Dubey is their middle order enforcer, then that’s what he will do. They are ready to shuffle their order but they stick to their guns when it comes to roles. That’s why you have clarity when you step out for them."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,Most players in CSK are veterans who are at the fag end of their career and thereby come with little baggage. Opportunity is more important than their batting position. I feel CSK makes them gel and vibe like a family.
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"When it comes to Watson, I’d say his batting position, along with the conditions at Chinnaswamy, didn’t work in his favor. At CSK, he had the support of a strong bowling attack, which made his role as an all-rounder much easier."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"a sense of security that you won't get at rcb, if you fail once you are gone but in csk they will give you enough chances and you never feel the pressure that this match is do or die for your career in this franchise.

watson was playing out of role i think he got 4 opportunities in 2 years to open which is his natural position. dube was given like 3 chances, even in rr he didnt have that big of a performance except that one game against csk where he railed us

rahana is a weird one i think on the backend of his career he definitely felt the pressure that he will get booted but in csk knowing that he isnt the only one in the backend of his career gave him some confidence that match against mumbai i still nut to that

moeen ali was playing in csk at a time when the batting depth was spectacular all the way down to 9 down there was people who could come out swinging and the approach was forget about consolidation we need to go out there and not slow down in the middle overs so he used to come and play a cameo of like 20 ball 35-40 runs

tushar is a weird one his bowling has never given me confidence and the wickets he take seems to be more like a batsman's mistake (the batsman thinks underestimates him and goes swinging edges and gets out on a shit ball like the ball to head was so garbage i dunno how head got out to that) cant say.

another example i want to mention just how bad rcb man management is kl rahul. he was playing in the middle order and his natural position is opener. we literally saw it a few days ago when brohit got injured kl got promoted to opening and he hasnt put a foot wrong since then looked extremely good while batting especially defensive shots"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"In case of Watson,he was considered more of a bowling all rounder considering the bowling unit they had were as in csk he was given his position as an opener and played as a batter throughout"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Different reasons I guess.
Shane Watson did not open in RCB and that was the time when RCB had giants in batting so he wasn't going to shine through his batting there
Moeen ali was good for RCB.
Tushar duspande I guess maybe dhonis captaincy but still can't say transformed because he's still so mid
But ye dube and rahane did shine"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"What does CSK do better? 
Nothing to be honest 
but
1. Identify the potential and giving them the well defined role, 
2. The freedom to explore
3. Putting a lot of trust in them to shine!

They back the players even when they failed to do the job! (That’s a debate point but CSK is like old school)
2020 was the year where CSK struggled to identify the potential of the players (maybe the worst season)"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Simple, even though the IPL is a shorter tournament in terms of duration. CSK and MSD have given players their trust & time. 

Even if these guys fail to perform, CSK had other players to fill into their shoes. The pressure was less comparatively. 

Whereas for RCB, their glimmer of hope was VK, ABD, Chahal and Gayle performing. The others in the team couldn’t afford to make mistakes (added pressure), if top guys failed.

Last season there was so much pressure on Lomror, Siraj, Patidar when players like Maxi etc failed to delivered."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"This is bias stats. You can see many other players who didn't perform with other teams but they join different teams let's say MI, RCB or KKR they did wonders.

It's all about forms. Like you can't say Kohli was great because he was captain but now not performing because Rohit is captain. Nothing to do with the team or captaincy."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,To be Frank the best version of Watson was at RR. That was when the whole world noticed of Watson the all round player!!
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Having the right roles for people 

Dube's role was to bash spin that's what he is good at 

Rahane can smash pace thats the role they gave him 

Watson is a seasoned opener so it was a no brainer 

Moeen got time to play his natural timing game at 3 instead of trying to be a finisher"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"RCB made Watson bat a lower place so that their KOHLI can make all runs 
In CSK 
Batters get chance to go up in order and they have no worries to stay in team because CSK won't change lineup after 1 or 2 failure"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Not sure how many more seasons it takes for you to realize that it is Kohli that messes up with other players batting order and styles.

Either Kohli needs to change his attitude around his batting position or he needs to retire for RCB to win a cup"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Don't know, but CSK is not like the other teams because CSK management runs multiple cricket teams across divisions and has been in cricket and team management for a long long time even before the IPL. So it's only logical to assume they're the most experienced bunch of team managers in IPL."

What do you guys think?,1285,"At least 7 games in Chennai , the heat , humidity and wet ball in the evening makes it a batters paradise if you figure out the game plan and conditions.

comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Lol...wattoo was much better with RR...same for Jadeja, buttler, faulkner, jofra, hodge, Sandeep etc."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Its just luck factor and how good form they are in

Watson later in 2019 did well in PSL too and became player of the tournament

This is the risk of taking oldie players. Either they are full out form or they just play the greatest cricket of the career"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Nothing ""different"". Shane Watson got the chance to open at CSK. RCB already had Gayle, Kohli and KL as openers. They got Watson for more of a finisher role and he also picked up lots of wickets for RCB.

Watson was 3rd in the 2016 purple cap (Bhuvi 23, Yuzi 21, Watson 20) at an economy of 8.5. He was not a failure. Moeen Ali too was amazing for RCB. Dube was underwhelming for RCB that I agree."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,Cunning OP didn't include watsons bowling figure with RCB. In 2016 watson played more as bowler with RCB. He was in top 10 wicket taker in that year
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"What I've heard is, they specify the Roles and what is expected of them. It can also be the form of that player during that particular season."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"That still isn’t the answer for the performance. Maybe for the batsmen to some extent. But what about bowlers, I remember even Nehra ji shining"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,True. This is important. I remember seeing Venky Iyer in Indian clothes and people saying that he is not a good finisher. And I was like why does an all-rounder always need to bat as a finisher. why can't he open?
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"RCB gave him only 3 matches in opening position (he was himself captain in 2) and didn't trust him after that - pushed him down the order

Meanwhile, in next season - CSK made opening pairs from old middle batsman of RCB and MI, and trusted them. Even when they had to keep Faf in the bench."

comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,">. It was RCB who asked him to change his style in that stage of his career by making him bat in lower order as a finisher

You can't blame RCB for this because they already had 3 openers (Gayle, Kohli, Rahul)"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,RCB after Mallya left went into hands of  corporate executives. They literally ran it into mud . We had our worst seasons ever under them . In 2020 they started to realize it’s a cricket team.

comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,Thats from Fleming and Dhoni. But taking care of a player is different thing. For example Irfan Pathan once said how players were allowed to take rest the next day after a match and the management booked tickets much later. Whereas the other teams would usally book flight tickets the very next day.
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,Rcb had 4 openers in their xi lol

comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Siraj had better performance last season compared to bhuvi, see their stats( wkt and economy column) that too while playing half of the matches in BLR. 

RCB released their proven player of last season Jack Wills and went for hit n miss player like Livingstone."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"then why buy watson? kohli is not an opener he was just the star player and rcb focuses more on kohli than the team which is why they never win, rahul should have opened but he was like 5 down or something"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Can't blame? RCB always used to be among the top teams with purse value in every mini auction and comes and buys truck load of openers and make them bat 1-6 . I remember RCB opening with Moen and benching QDK in a match. They opened with Hetmeyer in a match. Why? They used to buy openers and make them bat in middle order. Buy middle order players and make them open. 
Who else has to take up responsibility if not RCB? "
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,Only Gayle. Kohli wasn't a natural T20 opener. He only started opening for RCB cause they didn't have opening options back then. His position for India was always at 3 till 2024 & it suited him best. And KL wasn't consistent opener till he joined Punjab. Mostly he was no 4-5.

How r u gonna explain his form in PSL where he won player of the series in that very same time?and let me remind u Quetta Gladiator was/is  the RCB of that tournament"
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,Its because rcb has chokli as opener..50(45)
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Kohli is always better at number 3 than as an opener. Even in 2016, de Villiers and Warner had much impact with the runs than Kohli did."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,He averaged 16 that season before the last 2 matches(Qualifier 2 & The Final).
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"If you compare stats of both players of matches in bengaluru, delhi and wankhede, bhuvi was better than siraj in first 10 overs in 2024. That's exactly what rcb were looking for. Siraj failed for rcb in first 10 overs, at 10.3 economy.


Regarding Jacks and Livingstone, you are comparing apples with oranges here. Livingstone was bought as Maxi's replacement, not Jacks. Bethel was bought in place of Jacks. Bethel is cheaper, has the potential to play like Jacks. So this buy is justified as well."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Now for 2025, RCB sorted out by buying less openers like Salt and Padikkal only, they released Jacks and bought bethel for middle order. First time they did something right."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Absolutely he is. It doesn't matter how much he was bleeding or if that injury was a big one or not but what matters is his attitude towards it, his willingness to help his team win."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Gill left as a pre auction buy to GT as the team trusted Venky over him for his performances in 2021. Kuldeep left in mega auction after being benched due to Varun Chakravarthy's emergence.

Sky was backed for 4 seasons while kept dropping mediocre performances and only left during mega auction. 

Not KKR's fault that they all happened to hit their peak after leaving."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"Similar examples can be given for Csk as well,on other hand Kkr persisted with Stark through group stages when he was a social media meme"

comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"If I was a blind csk supporter, I would say that his CSK form continued to other leagues. But I didn’t say that. 

All I am saying is CSK had something to do with his form when he was at CSK. He himself said so. Go cry somewhere else."
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,kohli had 973 runs that season with a sr of 152 and david had 860 something runs that season with sr of 151 so how did warner had a greater impact?? you think shane watson could have done better at that position when kohli was in beast mode and plus kohli always prefer to open in ipl or else faf and will would have opened last season
comment,What does Csk do different? What do you guys think?,1285,"i rate bethel high he also gives a left handed option for rcb

the only thing is how they are gonna sort out their overseas in the XI.

salt bethel livingstone david and hazlewood

at the end we all know what happened to hetmyer

comment,Highest base prices at the IPL 2020 auction,192,It's because of the salary cap. But this is just minimum price these guys have set.

comment,Highest base prices at the IPL 2020 auction,192,"It's a six week tournament. There's a max of like, 12 games for any player. And yet, top players do get millions of dollars for one iteration of IPL. If you look at ""per  committed day"" basis, a mid-range IPL player is probably making more than a mid-range NBA player.

comment,Highest base prices at the IPL 2020 auction,192,"Doesn’t surprise me, considering the first round of CC matches are in April and May, and English players who are available are often not picked in starting XIs anyway, so there’s the toss-up of either chasing the IPL money but probably carrying the drinks the whole time (like Billings last 2 IPLs), or playing for your county and doing something meaningful.

He scored 445 runs just last ipl. Players older than him have had amazing ipl contributions. 

Raina also knows the Chennai pitch really well. Dhoni-fleming will squeeze any talent out of him, and make him useful for another ipl final run."

While true Raina has weaknesses, he has been handling it fine throughout the years. 

And you talk about non rcb bowling, which one tho? Apart from MI, Srh and Csk, all have mediocre bowling. Even MI and SRH bowlers get tonked. Kkr's bowling was trash last year. RR had lord unadkat. Kxip very inconsistent. Evem DC's bowling has huge holes. 

Raina can definitely find some form and get runs in ipl. It is still a level below international game."

If you think that's bad, then wait till ya see Jason Roy.

Every other team has some top foreign allrounder at 5 or 6 but has Indian top order batsmen.  
 
For the 2021 mega auction, we will unfortunately have to release one of these top 3 batsmen because we need to fix the overseas balance. Warner is the face of the franchise, so it’s down to Bairstow or Kane. If we keep playing 3 overseas batsmen+Rashid, our middle order will surely suffer."

Then Rashid is saving you 4x(10-6)=16. Rashid's value to the team is +16 runs over a replacement bowler. Let's set aside Rashid's wickets for this discussion. But they're separation from the majority is -30-ish and -58 against Mumbai. 

That model isn't sustainable. Amount of pressure on death bowlers is huge. Be interesting to see the diff between scored vs surrendered in death overs."

Are you serious? Jadeja had the highest SR(~210) last IPL against pacers after playing a minimum of 100 balls. 

Pandya himself had struggles in the England T20I series where the English bowlers exploited that short length outside off. He came back with a reply for that, but every batsman has their struggles.

I would rate Jadeja with Hardik mainly because Jaddu isn't fazed by raw pace."

Even that was a season of two halves for him. In the first 10 matches, he had 14 wickets, the purple cap and an economy of little over 7 per over. His final economy rate was at 8.3 per over and even his wicket-taking had dropped.

Secondly, Rashid Khan took 21 wickets as well but finished higher in the charts due to a better economy rate."

The thing that both of them lack over players like DK, Pant, ABD etc is range. Like as you said pandya struggled when the ball was not in the slot and raw pace is difficult to tonk over the bowler's head

I see jadeja struggling against raw pace as well

I just don't think he's on the same level against ""mediocre"" bowlers as pandya/pollard etc who are all dependent on raw power over finding gaps/exploiting the field, because his power game isn't on the same level as a pollard/pandya/Russel.

My comment was regarding Pandya and Jadeja.

Jadeja is limited in the shots he plays; I agree with that. However, that isn't a bad thing in most cases. He has that one shot where he tries to time the ball between short third man and backward point(?), and that is just pure class.

Pandya and Jadeja get the job done in most cases imo, but yeah, Pant is going to be a freak in the years to come."

Even when he plays that shot I described, it is fully timing. 

Recently, however, he has really increased his power game. Jadeja, at least in CSK, was never completely reliable to finish off games, at least when he was young. However, his batting has seen a meteoric rise in the last few years. That makes me happy as a CSK and an Indian fan."

Definitely agree on that, his innings last year vs KKR was mentally good

I'd always seen him do this about once every season, remember his innings against KKR in Eden Gardens to stop their home winning streak hitting shakib or narine for big runs back in 2013 or 14

But last season was probably the first time he did it consistently, and followed it up in the australian tour as well. I guess I'm being too skeptical but if he keeps this up he's definitely in that elite finisher category"

And two spinners Sunil, Varun are just incredible. Yesterday Henrich was looking very dangerous but Varun got him before he could change the course of the game. That was the deciding factor, game Changing moment for me. Had been Henrich still at the crease till 18th over, SRH could have scored 200+ easily.

comment,Well Ig we all already know who's gonna win!,1785,"I think the Eliminators should happen 1st then the 1st Semifinals, because currently the winners of 1st semifinals is getting optimum rest time before the finals, and the winner of Eliminators and Semi Final 2 gets less time to rest, therefore the winners of Semi Final 1 has been winning the IPL. They get Optimum rest, good time to strategize, and practice. 

We can keep it like this:

Current Playoffs Structure Pattern

1. Semi Final 1 - Tuesday

2. Eliminator - Wednesday 

(Winner of Eliminators get only 1 free day here)

3. Semi Final 2 - Friday 

(Winner of SF2 get only 1 free day here)

4. Final - Sunday

Even we might think that the #3 or #4 positioned team in the points table can somehow win till the Finals, but the mental fatigue will always be there with the Indian Summer scorching throughout the IPL. 

Instead we can follow this new Playoffs Structure Pattern

1. Eliminators - Tuesday - Venue A (#3 v #4)

2. Semi Final 1 - Wednesday - Venue B (#1 v #2)

(Here, the Losers of SF1 will only get 1 free day, but that is fine given they get another chance to win the IPL)

3. Semi Final 2 - Friday - Venue B (For Eg. #1 v #4)

(Here, again the winners of SF2 will get 1 free day and the winners of the Eliminators will get 2 free day which is better than 1 free day) 

4. Final - Venue A (The team playing winning SF1 will get 3 free days and the team playing winning SF2 will get 1 free day before the Final, but that is fair for all the top 4 teams compared to current playoffs structure, also the pitch in the Finals can be made on the same centre pitch used in the Eliminators giving equal boundaries from all side) (#2 v #4)

This is more fair to 3rd and 4th team in the table.

I actually prefer the old structure

SF1 - #1 v #4 - Tuesday - Venue Neutral to Both the teams

SF2 - #2 v #3 - Wednesday - Venue Neutral to Both the teams

Neutral venues will make it more challenging, but this is just a thought, if it is possible to make the pitch ready on all prospective venues then it will be interesting. Neutral venues will be decided right after the top 4 gets fixed (Again just a thought)

In this old structure the top teams who worked hard to be at top 2 postions will play with comparatively less dominant teams."

comment,Well Ig we all already know who's gonna win!,1785,"Ooofff... The same was said for RCB 2016, PBKS 2014, SRH 2018 & etc... & we all know what happened... If I were u I wouldn't be over confident (no offense).. A game of ipl is very unpredictable it can change anytime... Also at the start of this season everyone were saying that RR would easily win no competition at all but now no one even say RR so just relax it could be anyone's cup rn"
comment,Well Ig we all already know who's gonna win!,1785,"Although I'm a fan of CSK bcoz of MAHI, but this time i want RCB to win, as CSK can't play in the finals. Because I'm a fan of MAHIRAT❤💛"
comment,Well Ig we all already know who's gonna win!,1785,"I'd be happy if KKR wins cuz SRK is my favourite actor and everyone in my family supports KKR.
But, Kohli is my Favourite cricketer so I'd love to see RCB lift this IPL.  
At the end I'm going to celebrate if Rajasthan wins either, since I'm from Rajasthan. 
Sounds funny but that's the problem with IPL.  It doesn't have club fan followings like it does in football."
comment,Well Ig we all already know who's gonna win!,1785,"SRK is a god and he deserves to have the cup. His children are little angels, they deserve to be happy. His wife is a goddess, she needs to feel the heaven in this human life she took.

comment,Well Ig we all already know who's gonna win!,1785,"KKR will be playing final in Chennai. The one place where their batting collapsed

I think if their spinners don’t take wickets in Chennai and their batsmen fail, they could still find it tough in Chennai

Feel like it’s 50:50"
comment,Well Ig we all already know who's gonna win!,1785,I just hope they don't blunder in the end. I have a feeling that RCB might defeat KKR to clinch the title.

comment,Well Ig we all already know who's gonna win!,1785,"it's not rocket science

just don't go after their spinners

attack the rest of the bowling

SRH would have scored 200 (in spite of losing 4 early wickets) if their middle order had not attacked the spinners"

As it was said in another comment, streaks are meant to be broken and two such will be broken in the next few matches. One, RCB’s win streak and two, I’m thinking SRH will pull up in the finals. TH and finals has been an amazing love story in the past year and I’m thinking  it’ll continue."

Historically cricket didn't have much of a presence outside elite circles in colonial cities and princely states, while hockey was popular across the northern plains and football had mass appeal in two of the biggest population centers. 

Cricket isn't a sport built for garnering a massive captive audience, especially when it's competing with football- look at how badly it's getting beaten in the anglo nations. BCCI played a blinder in making it this popular in a country that's so sports-apathetic otherwise. Hockey and football otoh fucked up at every step.

India is pretty good now. We have been steadily improving since last 10 years. Also the difference between the top 5 teams is very negligible. Anyone can beat anybody among the top 5.

I just tend to be cautiously optimistic about Indian hockey because they have a tendency to do great against below-strength european teams at the champions trophy, world/pro league etc, only to bottle it at crucial tournaments vs Japan at the asian games & Netherlands at the world cup in 2018.

That said, the recent trend has no doubt been positive & the examples I cited are 2 years old. I'm hoping they succeed at the Tokyo Olympics, it is long overdue."

Dude, read my comment again with your eyes stapled open if need be. I said they had been far more consistent than India since the turn of the millenium, not that they are better than India right now. You really need to work on being less confrontational, particularly when you don't seem to comprehend points very well."

You see the problem with your logic. All I am saying is RIGHT NOW India is as good as any team and easily in the top 3. Maybe 2 years later they wont be. Who knows"

Remember he threw pregnant sita out of her home because of what a random bigot on the street said. Other relevant facts you may want to consider:  together with his brother, made fun of, abused, and disfigured a woman (surpanakha) expressing romantic interest because of her ethnicity; beheaded a shudra for daring to perform religious rituals denied to a shudra.

comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,Bumrah has almost double the overs than everyone else on that list. It’s freakish how similar his and Arshdeep’s stats are. Superstar in the making.
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"My man Bravo's economy would be down by 1-2 points had he bowled inside the tram lines. But hey, low risk(wide yorkers), low economy!"
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"Notes        
*minimum 75 balls        
*BPB: Balls per Boundary        
*NB-ECO: Non Boundary - Economy Rate

Arshdeep Singh is only 22 years old. Even Bumrah was not this good at his age. Arshdeep bowls like a 35 year old veteran, he is extremely smart and calm under pressure. He almost always delivers when his team needs him too, and rarely gets his line and length wrong. He is a top 3 death bowler in the world, let alone the IPL. Yet he has not even been included in India's T20 squad, let alone make his debut. 

How many age 19-22 year old fast bowlers have had this much success in the IPL? We may have a genuine prodigy on our hands, but he gets zero recognition. He has out bowled the likes of Shami and Rabada in this time period, which speaks volumes of his potential. If he played for Mumbai, Bangalore or Chennai, where would he be now?"
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,What qualifies as death in T20s? Last 5 overs?
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,Yeah man. If you look at the CSK sub you'd think he was the worst bowler on the planet because he bowled a few wides but the guy has been in good form with ball and always takes a big wicket when we need it.
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,Arshdeep has flown under the radar so much. Guy's a gun bowler. He's not ready for this year's T20 World Cup but he should be groomed for the next one.
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"Not rating him would be stupidity. Especially after 2021. He struggled for a while in 2018-2020,but returned back to form in 2021,and even this year has done quite well."
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"He’s extremely talented and definitely among the best death bowlers in the tournament (as agreed on the group)

But, calling him among the best in the world is quite a stretch. International games come with different playing conditions, more pressure, facing a larger variety of players etc.

A successful transition from IPL to international games isn’t assured. There have been very many players who didn’t succeed. But, Arshdeep is cool and calm so one would expect him to do well.

Should he be looked at by Team India? Absolutely Yes. 

Drafted into the WCT20 squad on the basis of IPL? Absolutely not."
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"I love Arsh but he is not in top 3 in the world yet. He could get there, his ability to handle pressure at the end and mentality towards the difficult overs is second only to Bumrah and he has the skills to back it up. But he needs to play internationals first and get a larger sample size like Bumrah to be considered top 3."
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,16-20 so yes last 5
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"Exactly. I see many saying he should be replaced with Pretorius. Pretorius is good, should probably be slotted in for Jordan, but I can't imagine our lineup without someone of Bravo's experience & quality."
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"the quality of batsmen are higher in the IPL than Internationals, where most teams play 2nd or 3rd string XIs.

The only bowlers missing are Shaheen and Starc, so even if you believe they are better (I disagree), Arshdeep is still top 5"
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"How many Indian fast bowlers are ahead of him in T20s? Assuming India brings 5 fast bowlers, excluding D Chahar who is ruled out, to the world cup...

Bumrah is a shoo-in, he can bowl anywhere. Harshal for middle overs and death. One of Bhuvneshwar and Shami for the new ball. And then that leaves 2 spots between Arshdeep, Siraj, Avesh and Natarajan. India already have a new ball specialist in Shami and Bhuvi which makes Siraj useless. Natarajan is very similar to Arshdeep, except he is too inconsistent and one-dimensional. So that leaves Avesh and Arshdeep.

And btw, all these bowlers have played T20Is on the basis of IPL. It is also not just 1 season, Arshdeep has been doing it for the last 3 years"
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"Sandeep is a very skillful bowler but kinda stalled since he can’t up his pace and is only effective in the PP.

Arsh is showing signs of being able to bowl across phases and has been increasing his pace to 140k. I could somewhat understand Sandeep not getting a chance, especially when he was competing with prime Bhuvi but Arsh is right up there with any competition from Nattu and Harshal. Probably won’t be looked at for this WC but should be brought in after it."

comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"Name 5 death bowlers better than Arshdeep. 

Also since every great death bowler plays in the IPL, except Shaheen and Starc, why don't they have better stats than him?"
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,Bhuvi wasn’t that good at the death when he started. He was always a PP threat but he developed himself into a top all phases bowler only after he went to SRH and during his prime. Arshdeep has been bowling in the death since he was 20.
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"He got destroyed by KXIP the next game as well. I think the season being suspended really benefited him because it gave him the chance to have a break after some bad performances.

comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"He wasn't even playing badly, and he's come back to the IPL looking dangerous, so idk what was up with SRH."
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"The problem is that death overs in three seasons of a single franchise tournament isn't very many balls at all. You are also looking at very fine margins. Arshdeep conceded 205 runs in this data, had he been hit for one more six his economy would rise to 9.11 and he'd presumably drop out of the top five. Say he gets unlucky next game and bowls a death over that goes for 16 (which could happen to literally any death bowler), his economy would rise from 8.85 to 9.14.

To list some death bowlers who are probably better than him at the moment.

Nortje, Bumrah, Bravo, Mustafizur, Fergusson, Starc, Shaheen, Archer.

Mostly because they've all proved themselves over a much longer period of time"
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"He made is IPL debut in 2011 and start bowling death overs from 2012. His economy rate in death overs in 2012, 2013 & 2014 were 7.35, 8.12 and 8.17 respectively.

Edit: Between 2012 and 2016, Bhuvi also had the 3rd highest tally of wickets in the IPL death overs."
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,I mean he went for 37. If I went for that much in an over Idk what I would have done. The maximum I went for is 21 still felt terrible
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"that is literally the point, Arshdeep doesn't. He concedes one boundary every 6.3 balls, that is more than an over. That is not easy to do, it is elite stuff. His economy rate on non-boundary balls is also elite, nearly identical to Bumrah. His dot ball% is very high as well. Every stat about Arshdeep's death overs is at the top of the charts.

And it is not just about the numbers, his yorkers, cutters, accuracy, line and length are excellent. He is so good at deceiving the batsmen. As for others, Archer is a powerplay merchant. He is an average death bowler. DJ Bravo has declined a bit and is still good, but not elite. Ferguson does not even come close, he is all speed, and often gets his line and length wrong. Mustafizur is too hot and cold, he is either in great form or beer league quality. Starc is also hot and cold, but not to the same extent. Shaheen is close, and debatable. And Nortje is elite, but has not looked great coming back from injury. The only bowler you can say is \*definitely\* better than Arshdeep, is Bumrah. Also 3 seasons is a long time, not to mention just how young he is"
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"He barely played 8 games across 2012 and 2013, not much of a sample size and the game was different 10 years ago. Teams weren’t nearly as aggressive at the death as they are now. 2014 was when he moved to SRH and started hitting his prime. He was 24/25 then. 

He was supremely talented and translated that into becoming a WC bowler but Arshdeep’s death overs ability and mentality has been very very good for someone so young."
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"I've never played professional cricket, but I've gone for 25+ even and still managed to be a better bowler than most.

and as I said, he had the purple cap at the time, and had a good spell, and he was in front of a world class all rounder in the form of his life."
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"> that is literally the point, Arshdeep doesn't. He concedes one boundary every 6.3 balls, that is more than an over

Of course he does. Everyone does. He doesn't literally concede a boundary every 6.3 balls. He concedes that ***on average*** so sometimes more, sometimes less (never mind the fact you can be hit for 16 off six deliveries without any wides or no balls and only concede one boundary). 

I mean he's already been hit for 14 in an over already this season by Russell. He went for 16 off his last over against RCB last year, 14 off his penultimate in the previous match against KKR, 13 in his last over in the match before that, 15 in his second over the match before that. 

None of that is a criticism of him. Literally every bowler who has ever bowled a meaningful number of overs at the death will have had overs where they've gone for lots of runs. Pretending otherwise is silly

>Archer is a powerplay merchant. He is an average death bowler

Archer's overall IPL death overs numbers are an economy of 9.08 and a SR of 17 from 56.3 overs, so a whisker behind Arshdeep but from twice the number of balls and without the benefit of last year's low scoring pitches in the UAE. He's also gone and done that in a load of other leagues and internationally for a number of years. 

> DJ Bravo has declined a bit and is still good, but not elite.

And yet his numbers in the OP are as close to identical to Ashdeep's as you can get and you describe him as "" at the top of the charts"". Surely you can see you are being insanely biased.

>Ferguson does not even come close, he is all speed, and often gets his line and length wrong

And yet over his entire domestic T20 career his death economy and strike rate are 8.13 and 12.9 from 57.5 overs. His international numbers are even better but have a small sample size

> Mustafizur is too hot and cold, he is either in great form or beer league quality

He has literally one of the lowest death economies in T20s ***of all time*** (third last time I checked)


> Also 3 seasons is a long time

It isn't (it's also only two an a bit seasons but that's my fault for saying it). It's 23.1 overs. That's about how many you'd expect a frontline bowler to bowl in a single FC innings."
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"What are you talking about? Bhuvi played 27 matches in 2012 & 2013 combined. Are you trying to say that he bowled during death overs in only 8 of those matches?

I remember batsman slogging in death overs is not something new. Do you have numbers to back your claim?"
comment,Top 5 economy rate at the death in the IPL since 2020,257,"death overs are from 17-20, Archer's economy at the IPL is 9.22, which is definitely average. Since 2020, it is 10.08. And DJ Bravo is still very good, but he has lost a lot of pace and has become pretty one dimensional. He is still doing a good job at keeping it tight, but at age 38, he has lost that fear factor. Although I'd still have him in my top 10. Ferguson's IPL economy at the death is 9.99, give me a break. He does not pass the eye test at all. I cringe watching him bowl at the death. He has that odd good game, but he is so bad at keeping that line and length intact. You can always count on him to deliver a slot ball or a nothing half tracker.

As for Fizz, here are his IPL's death overs economy's season by season: 7.83, 9.41, 10.44, 7.67. In T20Is for a comparable: 6.71, 6.58, 6.50, 10.30, 8.00, 9.67, 8.45. That is high variance. Look he is still an excellent death bowler, but he needs to be more consistent. Although there is zero question, that when he is bowling at his best, there is arguably no one better

And 23.1 death overs are a lot. And it is in the IPL, the highest quality competition in the word. And again, the numbers are just the results. The process are his yorkers, cutters, and accuracy which is world class. His smarts and ability to read and deceive batsmen are second to none, he is wise way beyond his years. Also obviously he has bad overs, but he also has equal or more overs where he concedes 6 or less runs. His ability to bowl under pressure and in tough situations is uncanny for a bowler his age. He has literally out bowled Shami and Rabada the last few seasons, who are viewed as world class bowlers."

But why? If no one cares about the format in bilaterals than why does the tournament matter?"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Oh bhai test mace is not a trophy, it was recognition for being no 1 ranked, nothing else, Dhoni was the worst red ball captain india had in the past 25 years. India lost 4-0 to australia, england, lost to sa at home , lost to england at home, lost to new zealand, everybody you name it in test cricket under hin, he didn't deserve to be test captain"

comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Effect of watching cricket from reels . Dhoni and ponting head to head . Dhoni -13 wins , ponting -9 wins . Dhoni never let ponting beat India in any knockouts . Only captain to whitewash mighty Australia in the MCG . Ponting had the greatest team ever gilchrist , Matthew Hayden , micheal Clarke , Shane warne , Mitchell Johnson , Glenn McGrath . This team even defeated Asia 11 . Meanwhile Mahi had a team where fast bowlers couldn’t bowl bouncers . Average spinners and a young batting lineup except Sehwag and Sachin .  A team like this beating one of the strongest Australian side is truly a great achievement. I’m sure you just hate him by watching some dumbass reel about him . You guys start crying after seeing travis head or pat cummins haha 🤣. My man dethroned the mighty Ricky ponting . Any format of the game Mahi is the best ."
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"That's just how things work bro. ODI and T20I bilaterals are never cared about unless some insane series like IND vs AUS 2013 but test bilaterals are very important and every match counts for the WTC

But ask anyone ""Cricket World Cup"" and the response is ODI WC. It has always been the peak of cricket and always will be!"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,Now listen . Msd is 2 times test mace winner. And to your suprise from the day india won 2007 wc to the day india won 2011 wc india never losta test match either home or overseas . It's just transition came after that and many old players couldn't continue so india had a bad record after that. That major transition never came under other captains.  Also he is the only one to defeat nz in home and in their home. He has best bgt record. And winning icc trophy was muh more difficult in that australian dominant era.
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Why don't you mention the positive things dude, 
1) Reached First place in tests under for very first time
2) First Indian Captain to win a series in New Zealand 
3) First Indian Captain to Draw a Series in South Africa.
4) First Indian Captain to whitewash Australia (4-0)

More wins than Sourav Ganguly in Tests and also better win percentage than Sourav Ganguly. 

Dhoni is easily the second best Test Captain for India, Best Captain in ODI and in T20Is he is along with Rohit Sharma - Both are the best in T20Is

Both Rohit and MS have lost against Australia,  lost a home test series but still both are the Greatest, Dhoni at the top!"

comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"So that means it becomes okay for him to get whitewashed away, lose to england at home and be extremely bad at red ball cricket. Its a captains job to handle a smooth transition not butcher it completely. He has a bad bgt record what are you saying, other captains have also defeated nz at home. He had a much much better team in that era, sehwag, gambhir, sachin, yuvraj, zaheer, dravid, Dhoni got the team in his prime, Rohit got it later when he had fitness issues and will become better than him if he wins the 27 WC"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,">First Indian Captain to win a series in New Zealand

We had won first in 1967. I don't think Dhoni was around that time.

>Dhoni is easily the second best Test Captain for India

Dhoni is a great limited overs skipper but can't agree with this pt of yours. None of the Indian captains before or after him have managed to lead Indian sides to 0-4 defeats in Eng and Aus. Add to that the second time he went to both those places he managed to lead the side again to series losses. Series losses in SA and NZ as well. Home series loss to England.

>in T20Is he is along with Rohit Sharma - Both are the best in T20Is

He was a great T20 skipper but this is going a bit too far. In Internationals, he lead India in 6 T20 WCs winning 1, runner up in 1, SF exit in 1 and group stage exits in remaining 3. Rohit on the other hand has lead Ind in 2 T20 WCs winning 1 and SF exit in 1. Statistically Rohit leads compared to Dhoni considering the number of times both of them captained Ind in such tournaments."
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Rohit has captained for much less years and has already won 2 icc trophies, If he wins the World cup in 2027 it will be a bigger achievement than 2011 because of weaker team and away tournament so no advantage that Dhoni had, He will surely become better than him. Also Dhoni presided over the worst phase of indian test team in probably its history, He should have resigned after it not captain for three more years"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"It was more like a memento to the ranked one team during those days. Not considered as a icc trophy. Only from 2021, it has been considered as a trophy because of the wtc."

comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Although he did runaway , we didn’t loose that series . It was a draw . Australia was the strongest team when Mahi was captain . So defeating them is a great achievement. Go and check head to head stats of Dhoni vs pointing. Dhoni -13 wins, pointing-9 wins.  In test , he won 2 test maces , the first captain who took India to no 1 test rankings . Won a series in New Zealand , South Africa . In t20 he won a World Cup man , how is he not good??"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Well even Rohit lost the series against Australia, and India won one match in the entire series and it was the one which Rohit didn't play and also got whitewashed against New Zealand at Home, MS Dhoni never got whitewashed at home

Sourav Ganguly also lost so many Test series.

Well MS Dhoni gets the blame for those losses against England in 2012 and 2014, unless you realize he was the only one to hold the innings together in both the series, he outscored Virat in both the series.

Well MS Dhoni didn't win in Australia, also at the same time didn't allow Australia to win in India and the only captain to whitewash Australia in tests and also the only captain to whitewash Australia in Australia [4-0 T20I series in 2016]

MS Dhoni is the second best captain in tests, best in odis and t20is [look at the kind of bowling line ups he won trophies with] if you can't agree keep crying.
Even espncricinfo choose him as the captain for odi team of the decade and t20i of the decade and also captain of the odi team for the last 25 years.

MS atleast drew a series against South Africa which others couldn't. 

MS Dhoni was also a good test batsman overseas not like how the social media has portrayed, Let's take SENA countries for example he averages more than Virat in England and New Zealand and more than Rohit in South Africa and New Zealand."
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"If you look closely for 2011 world cup Dhoni got almost the same bowling line up of 2007 world cup [Zaheer, Yuvraj, Munaf, Harbhajan](Changes were Ashwin for Kumble and Sreeshanth for Ajit Agarkar) and this is the team that lost to Bangladesh in 2007 and didn't qualify,  it was Dhoni who got the decisions right.
And it was the first time a country won a home world cup! At that time chances of winning a away wc was higher than home wc."
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"It was a narrative  Virat fans and other have started before 23, during trophy draught days, itself to show that we have a icc trophy. Almost everyone says, ms has only 3 icc trophies as captain."
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,They have other records and great achievements but beating World XI is not one of their greatest achievements. It's just another achievement for them.
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Before I start I would like to say I won't mention a fake fact in my comment like the one you mentioned of Dhoni being the first Test skipper to win a series in NZ.

>Well even Rohit lost the series against Australia, and India won one match in the entire series and it was the one which Rohit didn't play and also got whitewashed against New Zealand at Home, MS Dhoni never got whitewashed at home

Where am I saying that Rohit is a better test skipper? Do you have any reading or comprehension issues?

>Sourav Ganguly also lost so many Test series.

You are making the argument that Dhoni won with weak bowling attacks. Go back and check what bowling lineups did Ganguly have and still he never lost a test series away to either Aus or Eng in his leadership. If you don't know Aus of those times was the best team ever assembled comparable only to the Windies side of 70s and 80s.

>Well MS Dhoni gets the blame for those losses against England in 2012 and 2014, unless you realize he was the only one to hold the innings together in both the series, he outscored Virat in both the series.

When did I speak about his batting credentials? The discussion is about captaincy, stick to that. Dhoni went on to lose 0-4 to both Eng and Aus in 2011-12. Then had the audacity to captain Ind again to both Eng and Aus in 2014 and lose both those series. Only then his appetite for losses was over. I am not even mentioning the home series loss to Eng. 

>also the only captain to whitewash Australia in Australia [4-0 T20I series in 2016]

India never played a 4 match T20I series on that tour. I cannot fight a loser who brings in fake facts to prove his point. Aus gave a 1-4 ODI series drubbing to us prior to a 3 match T20I series which we won but it was never a 4 match T20I series. So I don't know from where did you bring this fake fact of winning the series 4-0.

>MS Dhoni is the second best captain in tests, best in odis and t20is [look at the kind of bowling line ups he won trophies with] if you can't agree keep crying.

When a captain has such a abysmal captaincy record in Tests and you call him Ind's second best Test captain it is a shame for us Indians as we had far better captains earlier and still never lost Test series as poorly as we did in Dhoni's era.

He is certainly one of the best when it comes to ODI leadership.

Again in T20Is I won't consider him the best. He had opportunities to captain Ind to six T20 WCs but went to win only 1 of those and even had couple of campaigns in which we went on to lose every game we played which is again disastrous. Compare that to Rohit Sharma who captained Ind in 2 T20 WCs, winning one and having a SF exit in the other. 

>Even espncricinfo choose him as the captain for odi team of the decade and t20i of the decade and also captain of the odi team for the last 25 years.

Does this even matter? Do you even remember who were the other ten squad members of such a chosen team?"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Even if they lost that diminish their skill level, dhoni had a much better and experienced team that nobody can deny, the batting was legendary in his team, all at the peak of their powers, also you cannot deny the advantage of having a WC at home, you know all the pitches and everything and have experience playing on them

If Rohit wins, it would be with a weaker team and in conditions not favouring him, so it would be a much bigger achievement than 2011 just like 83 is bigger than 2011"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"I don't care about virat. He has solidified his legacy as a solid test captain by keeping india no 1 for so long, beating australia, almost beating england, and being invincible at home but its just stupid for Dhoni fans to think that he was a good test captain when clearly he was not, he did not win an ICC Trophy in the format and was not a good test cricketer. Period"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Which captain before Dhoni had more wins in Test?

Most wins in Tests for India 

1. Virat (40 wins, Win % - 58.82%)
2. Dhoni (27 wins, Win % - 45%)
3. Sourav Ganguly (21 wins, Win % - 42.85%)

Okay small mistake, it wasn't 4-0, it was 3-0 but still a whitewash. 

Espncricinfo T20I team of the decade
Rohit, Gayle, Finch, Virat, Abd, Maxwell, MS Dhoni (C), Pollard, Rashid, Bumrah, Malinga.

Somebody is a better expert at judging MS Dhoni's captaincy than espn"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Batting line up was also the same, with any level of experience that should atleast defeat Bangladesh. 

By no means Rohit has a weaker team, this is probably the strongest Indian side of all time, credit to IPL.

2011 was such a competitive tournament, they had to face Ricky Pointing's Australia that had won the previous 2 editions and every team was so strong and those were times where even Ireland was very strong as they had knocked out England in that world cup.

In recent times all other countries have become pretty weak which was pretty evident in the champions trophy."
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,">did not win an ICC Trophy in the format

It is not Dhoni's fault WTC started in 2019, 5 years after he retired from test cricket. He had probably the worst pace bowling attack of all time in Indian cricket post 2011 WC. A finished Zaheer, Ishant Sharma 1.0, and guys like Vinay Kumar and Varun Aaron got test debuts. You cannot possibly expect to win test matches in England and Australia with that bowling lineup. 

And the batting was also going through a transition. Post 2011 WC Tendulkar only caring for his 100th 100, a finished Sehwag and Gambhir and 2014 Kohli who got absolutely owned by Anderson.

Dhoni wasn't the best test captain but he did the best he could do with what was provided to him

>was not a good test cricketer

Show me another test cricketer with a better batting avg. than Dhoni who was a wicketkeeper except Gilchrist and Rishabh Pant.

Gilchrist is undoubtedly the greatest wicketkeeper batsman in tests of all time and Pant's career is not over. He has only played in his prime and will eventually go through a lean patch like every cricketer. We can't judge him now"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Who told that he won a icc trophy in test? His fans itself would not rank him as the best, he dealt with the cards given to him decently. His team was good until 2010. Then the transition started. Just like how we are losing now with aging stars in test format. He was there for the transition where ash, jaddu, rahane, Pujara and Kohli himself all made their debuts and you want them to be world beaters in a first match itself. He had decent England tours as a batsman. Also, he was not the best and never claimed to be. 

Second, he has his own legacy as the best captain of India. Virat himself acknowledges him as his captain. He has won 3 icc trophies for India, he won it all at that time. 

You are the one thinking his fans started the trend. It was started by Virat fans on twitter, saying Virat has 4 ICC trophies, which are those test maces when they were considered as some memento."
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,Dhoni was terrible in red ball. Rohit is not much batter. They done well in white ball with some help from icc.
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,">Most wins in Tests for India 

>1. Virat (40 wins, Win % - 58.82%)
2. Dhoni (27 wins, Win % - 45%)

For the number of wins which he would naturally have having captained Ind in 60 tests which is the second highest by any Ind skipper.

Rohit has a win% of 50 in Tests which is higher compared to Dhoni.

Also, let me mention that Dhoni has one of the worse overseas win percentage of any Indian captains.

Take for example record in SENA countries-
Captained in 23 Tests - Won 3 - Lost a record 14 tests - Draw 6. Win % - 13.

Winning at home is not the only criteria of a good captain. Just 3 wins away in SENA countries at a win% of 13 says everything. It means for every 9 tests that he lost he could only win 1 after that. Second best Test captain my foot.

Learn about past Ind Test captains as well if you are a true Indian cricket fan and not just a fan boy.

A Wadekar was a Indian skipper in the 70s. Captained Ind to their first overseas series win in Eng. Captained Ind to its first series win against WI and that too in WI.

Before that we had not even defeated WI in a Test series either home or away. We had lost 5 test series before that against WI and not even drawn one series.

He even went to lead Ind to a home series win against Eng.

Only Ind captain to lead Ind to both home and away series wins against Eng.

To win against such nations away from home with the kind of team we had and the poor win loss record we had before him or even after him certainly puts him amongst the best Test skippers Ind had.

Rather I would even rate Rahane a better Test captain than Dhoni. Rahane did not lose a single test match that he captained. Won 4 of the 6 tests and drew 2 remaining. Went on to lead Ind to a historic Test series win in Aus with the weakest Ind side possible. I don't remember Dhoni having ever lead Ind with such a weak side like Rahane had.

>Okay small mistake, it wasn't 4-0, it was 3-0 but still a whitewash. 

Also you mentioned him as first captain to lead Ind to a Test series win in NZ.. fake fact.. lol.

>Espncricinfo T20I team of the decade
Rohit, Gayle, Finch, Virat, Abd, Maxwell, MS Dhoni (C), Pollard, Rashid, Bumrah, Malinga.

Anybody can copy and paste. I mentioned do you or anyone else even remember such a team. Yes you have reading issues that is why you could not understand the point I was making."
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Yeah you are correct, i mean shubman gill = sehwag,  hardik= yuvraj, kl rahul= Dhoni, shreyas iyer = gambhir, hardik bowls like munaf. Bro please man to man we had the strongest indian 11 by far in our history playing at home where we had a clear advantage with every player wanting to win the world cup because of Sachin in 2011, Dhoni had immense support from every player, how are you saying other teams have become weak, South africa is strong, new zealand is strong, england is strong going through a little lull period now, australia is strong, sri lanka is getting back up, bangladesh get upsets done here and there, pakistan had a bad toyrnament, they are weak but they recently whitewashed both australia and SA away in ODIs, So i dont see how teams are weaker now

Also ricky pontings australia in 2011 had had a bunch of retirements and it was not the same australian side you are talking about"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"Yeah like Saurav Ganguly, Anil Kumble had fast bowlers all lined up in their teams, Boss Dhoni wasnt a good test captain, people like saurav and anil took our test team to a level where we could compete, Under Dhoni our test team didn't progress it regressed badly

Also its the captain's duty to tell the selectors that these fast bowlers aren't good, get me others they cant deliver, its his fault taking them tour aster tour and believing they might work. 

Also I dont remember him playing a captain's knock in any of those disastrous tours, if others were not performing he should have stepped up being the captain and not let the team atleast get whitewashed badly

Dhoni was never a good red ball captain, he should have resigned following those disastrous tours, India didn't achieve anything in the next 2-3 years he captained more

Also, if he wasnt the captain he would have in no way been in the test team, tell me how many memorable or match winning test innings Dhoni played in his career, If not for captaincy, Dinesh Karthik or any other would have replaced him in the longest format much earlier

Pant and Gilchrist both have won matches for their teams singlehandedly in tests"
comment,Two legendary Indian captains.,912,"If Indian team is weak and not strong as you say then how did we win 23/24 matches, something that has never happened in the past.

And about that match against bangladesh, any great team can have a bad day boss that doesn't make them a weak team.
Will you call the west indies team that we defeated in 1983 final a weak team just because they had one bad day, after the 83 final they came to india and white washed us in all matches."

comment,needs to play more domestic test matches ,2272,"Funn thing is just around 2012 time Kohli started to show his great returns.

A 35+ average debut Aus tour where India was shit of shits.

A 60+ average debut tour in SA with Steyn,Philander,Morne prime to face.

 Then a 2014 debut NZ tour with 70 average.

His only shit tour came in Eng 2014 and after all the abuses and criticism he again belted Aus in Aus with 692 runs in 4 matches. And in that whole 12-20 timeline Kohli averaged 58 while being the best batter of India in Aus and SA by some steps.

And if you think that was just because of flat pitches in that Aus tour then you should also agree that Sachin,Dravid and co.'s 03, 07 Aus tours. 01 and 10 SA tours. Any Eng tour before 07 and all of their SL and NZ tours were on flats too. 

Secondly, it's not a basic progression thing to become good against spin after playing Ranji too. Punter was the best better in his domestic gig in his last 3-4 years and still was the worst batsman of that team in 07-11 timeline while getting out to Ishant,Umesh type of bowlers.

Cook was having decent returns in county too and still shat in internationals in his last years. So it's not a clear cut reasoning that somehow domestic makes you good.

One thing that I'll agree with that he should either retire or be thrown out of the team but making ""he didn't played domestic"" a point is just lazy when Kohli's best years in international were started just around 2012."

It’s a good shitpost. Domestic matches before an India series could help him get some practice but it’s all in the  nets he’s got to do. 

Sachin got chandresekar to bowl him many leg spin before Shane warne came to tour India and managed him successfully… but Kohli needs to literally have some spinners bowling him on the nets all the time"

IPL was big since it's inception. I'd argue, initially it was bigger than it is today in terms of impact because of no YT or social media. More people used to tune in because of how many celebrities used to show up regularly.

comment,needs to play more domestic test matches ,2272,He made a choice to have his family in London. And don’t give me this crap about privacy forcing him to move because there are tonnes of very famous and rich people in India who manage to live their lives in India. His decision to relocate his family is voluntary and if that is not compatible with his professional requirements then it is an issue. If he does not want to be in India where his job requires him to be then he should probably just retire and spend time with his family. He has enough and more money to make that choice. His wife is loaded as fuck as well.
comment,needs to play more domestic test matches ,2272,"While this is a shitpost sub, the sadness is that while we have grown our players perspective towards cricket has only gotten worse. Playing even one domestic game is beneath them to prepare for a series. 
They are afraid of realizing that their skill is not the same anymore even if it is not, they are just scared of it. Theh would rather get out on ducks in an actual series but play a domestic game to get used to Indian conditions. 

Rohit and Virat both are corrupted by their egos. I hope someone gives them a reality check that even they can be asked to play a final game. Happened with Sachin, can happen to them too."

comment,needs to play more domestic test matches ,2272,"""Your whole argument is calling for a lazy choice""

Playing 84 tests, 220 ODIs and 75 t20Is on top of 140-150 IPL matches is not a matter of lazy choices man. You gotta factor in that he was the best across formats in that time and was playing just too much cricket. 

""You can always do if and buts and not get out of your bed all day, would it make sense? No. Some practice is better than no practice""
Fully agree with it for the 2020-24 Kohli but shaping it for 2012 is just plain shit argument when the guy was playing non stop for a decade. You can't expect a guy to play 8+ test(35-40 days), 18-22ODIs, 5-8t20Is and 15+ IPL games and then find time to go for domestic too."
comment,needs to play more domestic test matches ,2272,"I agree on the commitment issue, he has to choose because his not being in form is costing us. Brohit too needs to work on that."
comment,needs to play more domestic test matches ,2272,"Kohli only played for India in this test series since the SA tour. There was ample time to play Duleep Trophy and get prepared for the NZ tour. Stop confusing yourself with the large numbers. In your job too, past doesn’t matter. What matters is why are you not preparing for the present. That’s where the 2012 number is being looked at cause now it’s showing in performance"

comment,needs to play more domestic test matches ,2272,"Again: I LITERALLY AGREED WITH YOU THAT AFTER 2020, KOHLI HAS BEEN SHIT AND SHOULD HAVE PLAYED DOMESTIC.

My only point was about 2012.

""That’s where the 2012 number is being looked at cause now it’s showing in performance""
Uhh so somhow a player averaged 57-58 in 12-19 and had 60+ average against spin just became shit because he wasn't playing domestic all these years after a decade ???
Please make it make sense man. 

Kohli used to improve on his own in thst 12-19 era. His after 2015 times were prove of his pull positioning(learnt from Abd), his 2018 Eng tour is perfect example for trigger positioning and his leg/trigger position against left arm pace/swing is easily an evidence of him improving.

It's just that he went shit house and never improved after 2020(never developed late cut, inside out and backfoot weight distribution for spin and offstump deliveries). 

That's why I said you can't club it with ""wooohhh he never played since 2012 in domestic"" when he never needed to because he was improving on his own. The problem came after covid where he is just not there."

Every time I watch him play I want to punch some sense into the Captains and Selectors whom he has obviously hoodwinked to be in their good graces for so long. With his mediocre technique and talent it was quite obvious he would never perform outside home in the ODIs. Dhoni's love for his fellow small-town, unorthodox cricketers has immensely benefitted the career of this mediocre cricketer. Also Dhoni the smart politician that he is has benefitted equally by adding a 'chamcha' to his already impressive collection of sounding boards."

comment,Kedar Jadhavs IPL stats in 2019 and 2020,242,"Raina left citing personal reasons but most likely left due to fears of Covid/Social distancing norms, etc etc"
comment,Kedar Jadhavs IPL stats in 2019 and 2020,242,"Had experience with a few of these types IRL, you will always see them in meetings, parties, always hanging around the ones who matter, and somehow coasting along despite very obvious mediocre talent. They just have a sweet tongue, talent for survival and the ability to stay in the management's good books, to the extent that even if the entire management was overhauled they would someone be the first to be on the best of terms with the new management. 

The first time I watched him bat and bowl, I knew instantly that this guy didn't have the game to perform consistently and would at best be a part-time batsman and bowler at Home and absolute shit Away. And then I saw him constantly hanging around Dhoni and later Kohli and other talents being overlooked and I realized this guy is the Ultimate Chamcha you will see in every private organisation around the globe. I don't want to say more, but he has just rubbed me the wrong way from Day 1, I've never felt this way about any other cricketer."
comment,Kedar Jadhavs IPL stats in 2019 and 2020,242,"Dhoni took them to final last year.

Bit stupid to compare Dhoni's one season failure (which hopefully will be last time he plays) to Jadhav who is constant be shitter in his entire career."
comment,Kedar Jadhavs IPL stats in 2019 and 2020,242,"He still hasn't done much wrong in Indian colours in the Odi format. People on this sub just parrot current popular opinions.

1389 runs at an average of 42.09 at a strike rate of 101.61.

People in this sub conveniently like to forget that he's won us matches as well."
comment,Kedar Jadhavs IPL stats in 2019 and 2020,242,Man I really cannot wait to see these uncles out of the team. CSK being such an iconic IPL franchise with such passionate fans deserves an exciting team.
comment,Kedar Jadhavs IPL stats in 2019 and 2020,242,"I've honestly grown tired of the groupthink and reactionary nature of this sub (and reddit as a whole). The moment a player starts to struggle, their entire existence starts to get challenged and all past achievements cancelled out."
comment,Kedar Jadhavs IPL stats in 2019 and 2020,242,"His uncle died on 19th August and he left for UAE on 21st. It could be a reason for his return but it's not as if the incident took place when he was already in UAE and had to return back. Honestly, I think there were a number of issues for his departure, death of his uncle included and so the balcony issue.

This year he is out of it and should have retired from IPL."
post,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,N/A
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,That one dreadful night robbed him from being the only indian captain to win 3 ICC trophies in 3 years🥲
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"We can troll his test results as much as we like but he’s a white ball great, both as captain and player. His late career resurgence has served India well. I doubt he’ll play for too much longer, but he might go till 2027 because his white ball legacy is just missing the ultimate crown of an ODI WC."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"This a legacy. One of the best players in the ODI format ever. Even better captain. Kuldeep mentioned how selecting spinners was months of brainstorming. Rohit analysed a lot about it every match. Bro ain't kidding when it comes to ICC tournaments. 23 was unlucky, but time changes. Goat captain for me🐐"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Indian cricket team captain for a reason! Hope he is able to play till 2027 WC
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Could have got WTC and odi WC as well.  still remember how we used to call him 2min  maggy guy.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Bro would have been stacked only if he had the 2023 wc
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Dunno why we stopped Nidhas Trophy after 1 series, tri series are just so cool. We should have a tri series with Pakistan and Sri Lanka every two years"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,So in terms of trophies that count he's won a single T20 World Cup?
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,2nd best indian captain surely ?
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"We might get another brilliant white ball captain like MS or Rohit... What I really want is a red ball captain like Kohli/Ganguly...I still prefer test dominance over shorter form dominance... I don't mind and actually enjoy this short format dominance ... 

But that era with Kohli and realms was unbelievable red ball games is what I want.. who can take over with same passion as virat and make the team dominate again...?"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"ICT fans, do you think Brohit will be better than Dhoni? (If he wins the 2026 T20 WC at HOME as a captain)"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"It's for banglawash bros. The real no 1 team in the world. If the weather and umpiring were just, they'd have won EVERYTHING!"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,That trophy fooled people into thinking DK is actually good lmao. He even got to play 2019 WC based on that.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,That trophy means more to me as a fan than so many more prestigious wins. That match was our javed miandad game winner. Even if the context wasnt so meaningful it was definitely one of my favourite moments as a fan.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,3?
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"That's his problem due to his captaincy,
Why so sympathy?
When kholi didn't won the ICC,
Why were fans trolling him,

And Wct20 was won by luck,due to hardik pandiya
Otherwise Rohit had already lost that final due to his captaincy,


As a dhoni fan ,I am telling this,"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Tests too he was indias best batter for last 3 years till nz series .
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"He’s definitely in top 2-3 players for the best ODI opener, and best batsman in last 2 ODI world cups. He’s crazy good and consistent. It’s a delight to be able to watch him."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,I just want him to stay relevant in cricket for him to make case till 2027 wc. He can only and only stay relevant if he plays good red ball cricket. That means playing ranji and other domestic tournament and playing the occasional odi series. And grooming the future captain. For me it is shreyas iyer who is a clutch white ball player and a captain.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Privileged to witness 3 consecutive transformations of limited over Indian cricket under three remarkable leaders - Ganguli, Dhoni, and now Rohit…

I like the trajectory!"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"You guys are all so fake. I'm a diehard India supporter as well but after the BGT this whole sub was begging Rohit to quit and chatted 24/7 about how shit of a captain he is. And that hasn't changed, he's still a shit captain which was proven in that test, he just happens to have elite players around him. Can't believe how fickle minded India supporters are"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"The goat is ms dhoni. Today's era is different, Teams are different. Cricket was much more competitive."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,There is no brain storming needed. A simple common sense was needed to pick up 4 spinners to play on used surface of Dubai
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Only 2 years to go for the WC. If this current team manages to stay as fit then we got a good chance of winning it.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,I will get down voted to hell but it should have been Rohit after Dhoni retired. Koach was a good captain but Rohit was always the better one. He had 3 IPL trophies as a captain when Dhoni retired
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,">Could have got WTC

How? There were 3-4 deadweights and mediocre bowlers for English conditions."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"> Could have got WTC and odi WC as well


You have to win to get them, not just set up camp in Dubai for a few weeks."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Only the greatest championship tournament of all time.  Look up the video highlights if you can. #BangBrosBest
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,The one match in 2018 where Dk went berserk and the final over which is the most watched cricket video on sri lankan cricket youtube channel.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Up there. Obviously Kapil Dev and Dhoni are strong choices. Ganguly deserves a mention too - he didn't have the best success,  but he took over a side under the cloud of match fixing with key senior players banned."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Bro he’s retired from T20. Either way, he’s already added his name in the GOAT Indian captain debate alongside MSD and Kapil Dev."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,He's retired from t20s mate!!!
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Dont forget 2022 t20wc based on his ipl heroics.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,What was he supposed to do when India lost 3 wickets on 5 runs.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"WC in 2023, T20WC in 2024, CT in 2025

Edit: Just remembered we lost WTC also in 2023."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Ohh dhoni fan, your thala was the luckiest captain 😂 Rohit defeated your thala 4 times in IPL finals

Having a complete team in 2011, came to bat against sri lanka in peak dew at wankhede, malinga, kulasekara & murali couldn't even the land the ball where they wanted, same malinga & kulasekara bowled 24 consecutive yorkers on the spot in 2014 to same three finishers Kohli, yuvraj & dhoni, your thala couldn't even lay bat on ball, 2011 final sanga knicked a half tracker from yuvi, dilshan wicket was lucky AF

Misbah literally gifted that T20 world cup in 2007 even that would've been impossible if Rohit hadn't scored 30 off 16 after peak performance of 6 off 10 by your thala, or if RP Singh hadn't taken wickets early & irfan with timely strikes

Now coming to CT, england needed 20 off 17, when morgan, bopara & buttler gifted it away, moisture in the pitch allowed your thala to bowl two overs of spin at the death, when did that ever happen in england, still india would've lost but those two crucial moments of fielding awareness by Rohit one resulting in bresnan's run out & diving save to stop 4 from tradewell 

The moment your thala's luck ran out, ICT lost 3 knockouts in 3 years, don't forget your thala lost 7 ICC events which has 4 group stage exits😂"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"If T20 was luck, this is luck pro max. This was a tournament where strike bowlers of your opposition were not playing in and you're still struggling to win. As an ICT cricket fan I'm happy since the trophy is a trophy, but this would get exposed in future tournaments."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Exactly, i get he's not that aggressive but when you look at his tenure, he's always playing without some main player, some series no shami, then no bumrah, Kohli sitting out one series, it's difficult to captain without main players

What happened in NZ series would've happened in Eng series if he hadn't scored those 100s"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Agreed. He can probably focus on ODIs only. Would be great if he can continue his form till 27 WC. He himself would step back if he cannot commit.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,I doubt if anyone is still advocating for him to lead the test setup... And nobody ever doubted his limited overs capacity.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Didn't look like that when experts started questioning this decision calling it a big mistake. And didn't really see much backing for Varun so credit where due
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,We just need a reliable 3rd pacer behind Boom and Shami for 2027 as the World Cup is in SA and we will need pacers over there. The batting is as good as it gets if everyone continues their form
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Agreed. Between RCB and India, he's won zero silverware as captain. 10+ years combined.

Great player, but his tenure as captain might be one of the worst ones out there."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Boom roasted 🤪🤪🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥 India couldn't have won without setting up a camp in dubai 😂😂😂  Who tf is saying they won for playing good🤬🤬
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Wow you’re so funny hahaha ecks dee

How long did it take you to come up with this very original comment?"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Bro managed to keep his spot in T20s for years to come after that one innings. 😭
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Most watched cricket video of all time on any channel


And even the 2nd most watched sports video ever on YouTube (some WWE is perhaps No. 1) "
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Ganguly has to be up there too - helped turn the team around after the match fixing saga, co-won the 2002 CT (with India ahead in the game on both washout days) and got India to the final of the 2003 WC."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Fact of the matter his whole international career is just 10-12 good innings spread across the formats, and he's lauded like a fucking legend."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Match was India and entire packed Sri Lankan stadium doing nagin dance vs 2 Bangla batters (Mushfiqur). But it peaked when DK was facing the last ball. Entire stadium was willing DK to hit that ball. 

There were SL fans dancing infront of where the Ban fans were doing the nagin to their faces lmao.

Shit was peak subcontinent toxicity.

Vibes will never be matched. 

[Proof.](https://youtu.be/kZ3Ciy2qULU?si=xJXPGVvq-dDxXcCe)"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,By that logic every series that went close (with some controversies too) should be here. I'd rather rate a bilateral with/in SENA more than this nidhas with SL and Ban.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,Didn't we lose 2023 finals tho....
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"No bumrah, siraj or Arshdeep, shami leaked runs, we literally won it in 49th over, new zealand bowled 4 spinners like india & they bowled really well, seamers had nothing in this pitch

It was jamieson who was the difference in WTC final & his figures yesterday were 5 overs 24-1 which is good enough, O'Rourke troubled india in NZ series, so it's not like they were outrightly weak

Trust me whatever happened to O'Rourke, would've happened to henry as well, bcoz it happened in ODI world cup twice"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,I meant moreso that he was a mediocre (imo) test captain. As a player his record is still solid even if it’s not among the greats.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Yes true. He really needs to tone down physically. Its not like he is not agile, but he will become more fitter. Mind you he is still a good slip and inner ring fielder."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"I dont think any experts questioned that. Rohit fans are making it up. When Jaiswal was ousted and Varun was included in the final squad it was clear that they wanted to take used pitches of Dubai.

This was the case when India picked 4 spinners in WT20 too coz India were well aware that they are gona play their semis in turning surfaces of Antigua. There was no brainstorming needed there"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,The world was saved that day due to DK. That shit was about to turn into 3rd World War
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,yeah that's why the original commenter said that he was robbed of winning 3 ICC trophies in 3 years. He didn't say he won
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Lol we literally had Arshdeep in the squad but we didn't pick him. We didn't pick siraj in the first place in the squad of 15. All I'm saying is someone like Matt Henry could have made a difference even on this pitch. NZ played with part timers as spinners. Good that we won, but what I'm trying to point out is that on a big day, when there's a strong opposition, this would fall out."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Nah australia could've won with the z team too, it's just that india set a camp in dubai which gave them a huge advantage. Indian team has no talent at all. Average Australian hippie can score better than virat kohli. Bcci cannot win without cheating 🤬🤬🤬"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"No problem he can be highly regarded in domestic circuit. But the problem he's hailed as a legend in Indian cricket, whereas he's nothing more than a footnote in our cricket history. He's been given umpteen no. of chances and he doesn't have much to show for. The only impactful tour I remember of his was 2007 England tour, where he really played well opening in English conditions."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"lol nobody considers DK a legend of Indian cricket. Of Tamil Nadu, yes. But at best, for India, he is considered one of the most liked cricketers by his team members."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,If we had Bumrah we wouldn't have shami. Either way we were covered. All I'm trying to say is that this would get exposed in next ICC Tournaments.
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"What? Upon his retirement, I saw many social media posts hailing him as a legend with emotional songs in the reels.

Maybe it's some hardcore DK fans. But it was all over the place."
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Next ICC tournament is T20 world cup, where there are different players except hardik & axar & we've seen how brutal they're 

By next ODI world cup most sides would have new players"
comment,Rohit Sharma's trophies as a captain,905,"Must be Tamil people doing that. We do tend to make a lot of noise online. Ashwin is an Indian legend, DK is not."

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Someone please bring a time travel machine and bring the whole of MI 2020 team so we can have a match between KKR 2024 and MI 2020
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,People saying RCB 2016... What the hell are you smoking? It was a one-man carry job the whole season.  RCB 2015 had a better line up than 2016.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Feel like 2016 RCB shouldn't be in the discussion. They did lose 6 games in the group stage and qualified second - not really the dominant performance which is anywhere near 2020 MI or this year's KKR
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"This years kkr performance was like the worldcup india equivalent only here they won the final..

No other team comes close to what results kkr produced this year"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Only Punjab can beat KKR that too when they are met with extremely unbeatable circumstances like KKR putting a 262 run target.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Tough battle but KKR slightly wins, got opponents allout 6 times says alot, MI was filled with big big names like rohit, qdk, pollard, boult, bumrah, malinga. Look here, starc who got smacked in first few weeks, two key pacers of the team are uncapped domestic bowlers, even their sixth bowler has 19 wickets. Don't wanna talk about spin, KKR is far ahead in that. I'm not even counting whole league, just since they got humbled by punjab, it's tough to digest such defeats for many but the way they came back, cannot be matched. Coming to batters, they didn't even have to depend on their finishers. What more could i say"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Let me remind you KKR didn't got chance to play 2 matches at league stage. Considering those 2 matches their run rate would have went more than 1.5 which will be hard thing to achieve.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"This is another classic example of “fan favourite statistics”! 
RR of 2008 not selected as RR team doesn’t have famous Indian names, therefore they don’t have a huge fan following.
If you look at their numbers, they stayed on top and finished on top with just 3 loses(22 points). Defeated CSK, the second best team comprehensively all 3 times including the final. 
RR not good on paper as they had no big names. But what a team they had in 2008. They had 3 all rounders, 4 if you count warne."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Dc 2021 was better than 2020 and rcb 2015 was better than 2016.
And MI 2020 form of their players was good as opposed to this big names thing you said (bumrah russel pollard hardik have performed more or less every ssn) -kishan at 4 , krunal , rahul chahar"

There is no comparison mi squad of 2020 was absolute beast"

I am saying abt bowling linenup bcz in both matches KKR had batted well too. It was just KKR bowlers who failed to take wickets.

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Rcb 2016 is overhyped due to the magical season kohli had RCB 2015 was more dominant than 2016
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Yeah..but some guys in the subreddit were saying that RCB 2016 should be included.
I mean why?😂"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,RCB 2016 and RCB 2024 comeback was amazing winning back to back matches and qualifying for playoffs for real
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,They love overhyping everything related to them. If you visit their sub you'd think they won many 🏆 with the way the talk.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,This is exactly like 2014 but just reverse. Punjab dominated every other team in that season but lost to KKR 3 times that season.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Malinga didn't play in 2020
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Rr 2008 was amazing ngl. I think most people here didn't watch the first season of ipl and therefore aren't considering it. They had 22 or some points I think?
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Yeah but the first season is always not considered. It was a rookie season with players and teams being clueless about T20 cricket. As a team performance in terms of win percentage RR 2008 takes the cake. But if you time travel a RR 2008 team against either MI 2020 or KKR 2024, it’s going to be demolition job."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Punjab Kings realised they needed a win to move to 6th or (maybe 8th out 10)..hence the 262 chase.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Not true dude, this ipl was only close in the middle of the table no one except RCB was even a contender once rr choked"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,KKR didn’t even used Impact Player in the Finals and the Qualifier 1 tho.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"So? Did only KKR get impact player? The other teams played 11 players?

Mi played with only 5 bowlers but opponents also had only 6-7 batsmen.

KKR played with 6 bowlers and opponents had 7-8 batsmen. 

Mi had only a beast squad. Performance wise they weren't as good as KKR has been."

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"I think they meant MI had more superstars on it. KKR didn't have any popular game changing match winners other than Russell, Narine and MAYBE Starc."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"There's also this thing when a team has many novice players: at present you'd think there aren't many bigshot players, but if they come to fame later on in their career - in retrospect, the team would have big names."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Better according to big names...like they attract more hype and more people remember their 2020 season...whereas KKR had many uncapped players who had performed surprisingly good.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"MI is clear? Even after showing how the stats between them are so close, you are still saying MI is clear🤣"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Hardik didn't even bowl that year. He was playing as a specialist batsman only still MI dominated the league
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Mumbai bias is Crazier tbh....they are the most successful team no doubt....but that doesn't that they are unbeatable
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Toxic? I just posted a pic which compared the stats for two teams for a single season. No where did I boasted that ""KKR is best,Mi is nothing "". Don't be so gullible."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,">RCB 2016

They weren't the best, GL were the table toppers and SRH won the league, so I don't get how RCB 2016 were the best? RCB 2011 and 2015 were better than RCB 2016."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,They were a great team too but since they failed to win a trophy they cannot be considered as a successful great team.

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Bowlers cannot do anything on a highway,  but even if the pitch gives 10% aid to the bowlers KKR will defeat every team in existence"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,272 or 262
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"That's because DC 2020 didn't had any big superstar in its team that would attract any hype...it was a just well balanced team only, whereas MI being 2019 champions ,that had lot of hype.

In 2024, SRH had Pat Cummins as captain(who became really famous for his achievements in last few years and even defeated a strong India in finals of CWC23) hence everyone started hyping SRH too much more before the finals even though they weren't a balanced team, they just had threatening Opening Batsman."

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Yes, but KKR has played in 10 teams IPL, which evens out."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,">every team was buffed up in 2020. that's why there were so many super overs

Many super overs because teams were equal in strength, not because they were very strong individually. Key difference.

And in that season, the biggest match winners were guys like Tewatia, KL Rahul and Padikkal...the same players aren't even in consideration for the best players in the IPL this season."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"The Eden gardens pitch Curator was supposedly making pitches that are not suitable for KKR bowlers.
What can they even do? Even after all the shitshow in the Eden Gardens, they won 5 out 7 home games.... Despite so many disadvantages KKR came out victorious..this itself makes them a great team"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"That was one bad match.....one setback for the team.....but they also made an amazing comeback from it and not letting opponents score even 160.

This shows great mentality.

Also peak 2019 MI conceded mighty 232 runs against Russell-Dependant KKR.... does that mean 2019 was bad for MI, no way...they made a comeback from it and hence deserved that year's trophy."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"It's not my opinion...but most guys on reddit,insta, Twitter and even some Commentators say that 2020 is the greatest team ever...that they could even win the T20 WC. I being a KKR fans just wanted to compare the performances of both teams."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"It is overrated af lol, they lost to one of the worst csk sides and will chalk it up to first match tax"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Definitely Thala has mastermind abilities..but CSK also got lucky both in 2021 and 2023.

2021 final(tripathi and DK both were injured and couldn't bat and keep the wickets well, still they had to play, Russell was injured before final too)

2023 final( GT even after playing so good, the rain happened and caused the target to be reduced, and luckily CSK had longer batting depth , so they batted aggressively and not to forget that brainfade moment from Hardik-Mohit Sharma in the last over)"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"No man we were not ' better' . Statistically Punjab was far better , but after the horrendous first half we went for a comeback like no other team have ever done . Even in final punjab scored 199 but well then they met Piyush Chawla"

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Lol, if ipl was that easy to predict we wouldn't have expected even 2 trophies from MI"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"True Rohit,Pollard,Hardik, Krunal will simply give their wickets...only Ishan kishan, De Lock and SKY(maybe) stand a chance against those spin twins."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"2020 MI was a diff beast, that team would have ruled in chepauk. They beat csk twice in chepauk in 2019"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Despite all of that they have a very good record at chepauk. I don’t think KKR line up does great against swing. Imagine having boult and bumrah bowling in tandem , even they got no chance"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"🤔🤔😂😂😂Lol.....mi vs kkr is the most one sided rivalry in IPL.
KKR won against MI continuously since last year.
MI(23) vs KKR(10) before 2023 it was 23 vs 6.

KKR always choked against MI."

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,*3 men carry job with Devilliers scoring important runs
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Yeah Starc would have bowled out SRH in just 150-160 and RCB would have won easily
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"After that they played against SRH, LSG, MI and DC. I can say only DC was trying to compete to get into playoffs,
LSG and MI had already checked out."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Cause teams were lesser back them. On paper, KKR is a weak team. I never said it's a strong team. But it's performance was much better than other so called strong teams. 

KKR punched way above their weight.

Edit: It's not KKR's fault that they were so good towards the end when they had a full team. Competition comes when teams perform poorly."

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"That still doesn't mean they were one of the greatest teams. For sure, great comeback, but it also means that they were a shit team for the first half of the tourney. The greatest team has to be the team to beat throughout the tourney"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,4 times iirc*
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"What logic is that lol??? 2008, a rookie season? They just played a WC a year before in 2007. In the first IPL you could see many 200+ scores, many 140-160 scores, it had everything that current seasons have. You cant say it would be a demolition job. Remember RR of 2020 defeated MI and RR of 2024 defeated KKR. So any team can take on the giants. Its all about who shows up in the final.. which requires courage and fearlessness, which Warnie's RR had

What you said can also be applied to MI 2020.. all players had no practice because of covid and the teams were clueless. Thats why MI won! That sounds lame right!!!

Also the first few season had minimal to low fixing. Now a days it all looks staged. For example the twin super overs by MI in 2020(de Kock's runout), GT winning 2022, SRH losing 2024 (no way Jay Shah is letting Cummins win an IPL. Its like a consolidation win for Indians!). Dhoni suddenly playing like vintage Dhoni and striking 200+. Others in the team are struggling but Dhoni with no cricket practice since last IPL plays like AbD. Felt strange..."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"They used it for half of the season in more than half of the matches it was raghuvanshi who came as a surprise package for kkr when nitish Rana got injured
It was after the mi game where starc gained form and after that there bowling fired"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Sorry but I'm not getting fooled by stats, KKR did wonders but I really don't think salt Narine s.iyer could survive against lethal peak of bumrah and boult in IPL."

Thank you for your concern but  I'm not smoking anything just confused with the scores."

This year was fun as the things didn’t go our way. Usually I’d skip mi vs kkr because mi would easily crush kkr making it a boring match…"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,No doubt they were a great team but imo Mumbai 2020 were slightly better. Batting stats of every team were damn good this season due to the horrible pitches so I would not be too critical of mi 2020's batting stats
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,You forgot ipl 2020 is much harder because of bowlers
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Yeah I agree with you , but CSK also had unlucky moments like Watto injury , Deepak chahar injury , Shardul unable to take single , Ben stokes unavailability, Pathirana & Fizz unavailability in 2024 etc

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"on fast bowling supporting grounds like wankhede, chinnaswamy, MI has more chance. on grounds like ekana, chepauk, kkr has higher chances. eden gardens is equal."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,that MI team isn't for slow pitches. they literally compromised on spinners to get good fast bowlers. the team is made for wankhede and fast pitches.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"I was referring to devilliers as our second carry. Watson was alright as a bowler, but did not contribute anything with the bat. Hard to call that a carry."

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,You forgot Q1 then? Might consider replacing that RCB flair for a Virat one
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"See if rr didn't turn into RCB towards the end of the ipl and that guwahati match wasn't cancelled rr might've beaten kkr (given how good they were before) then qualifying top 2 and giving kkr good challenge. This ipl was more about middle order fight then top order, mi had to face prime csk/dc doing pretty fckin good and so on."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Those 8 teams are more powerful than those 10 teams and lsg and gujrat titans was shit in that ipl
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Not a disgusting bowling. You had yuzi and Watson who were in the top 5 in the purple cap list. So it ain't disgusting in any way.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Yeah for first half they were shit and in second half only ABD and Kohli were playing and took it to playoffs even Gayle was out of form and their bowling line-up was the worst ever in ipl history
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,3 times
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,What are you talking about bro ? The whole fight was for the number 4 place almost everyone knew rr kkr and srh where going to qualify
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,and what really benifited them due to that bro reality is imp is just for namesake batters rarely makes runs only manish pandey innings were impactful and angrish first innings were impactful😄
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"You won't know bcz Narine isn't a normal batsmen, he can get bowled on the first ball itself or smash some 10-15 runs in a single over."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Narine has smashed Mr Footballer Boult this year and even scored a century vs RR this year.

Yeah sure Salt and Shreyas wouldn't have done much but KKR still had Venky,Russell, Ramandeep and Manish Pandey who can play Bumrah well."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Intimidating is not a criteria to compare 2 teams. Performance is. KKR better in all stats
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Yeah ..I have seen the comments, it seems we have no right to say anything that makes the big 3 look bad😂🙏"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Its supposed to be the greatest team of all time, not an invincible. All great teams have their bad days. The PBKS win was more of a KKR brainfade than a PBKS masterclass. Also when you know the ball is literally doing nothing off of the pitch, it becomes way too easy to just swing the bat and score. Then it just becomes the matter of knowing what target to score. You can't possibly convince me KKR couldn't have tried and finished the chase themselves if it was posed by PBKS batting first.

Also just look at every single game from then on. Literally every single bowler showed up on wickets that even gave them a sliver of help. Their lower middle order basically never had to show up in any of the 5 chases they made. If that ain't domination, I don't know what is."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Ok my bad, I thought 2024 KKR can defeat 2020 MI 100% of the times but after thinking a bit, maybe MI can win against KKR under the conditions 

MI is chasing, the Pitch is a highway and at last dew is there to help MI. 

Under these conditions also MI needs a bit of luck since KKR will give a target of 250+"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Do even realise that KKR has chased matches this year even without the middle order coming to bat. The middle order which consists of the likes of Rinku, Russel, Ramandeep. Had MI2020 chose to bat first against KKR2024, the match would have been over then and there itself."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"You're using one match to give minus points to KKR. No one here is going on match-by-match basis. I'm not getting butthurt, just pointing out your idiocy :)"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"So in 2020 MI bowlers (who are referred to as the most dangerous bowling line up) took 111 wickets in a total of 16 matches with only one opposition team being all-out.

Whereas in 2024, KKR bowlers took 110 wickets in just 14 matches (one less wicket taken with two less matches played than MI 2020)....that too in an IPL season where it was batting-heavy pitches with scores like 250+ happening multiple times.

This data alone concludes that KKR bowlers(for 2024 season) shouldn't be considered as a weak or average lineup. It's the most complete Bowling lineup since last few years."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,I was referring to a post that mentioned about Raina’s innings in the 2014 Q2 😂 he deleted that comment after my reply
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"That prediction takes historical data into account and MI has sheer dominance over KKR 23>11 and you completely ruled out MI, that's not a prediction"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,KKR 2024 has best fast bowling so I doubt they will be able to win anywhere
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,But 2020 IPL was played in UAE
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,2020 wasn't played in wankhede also most pitches were in fact slow

Lsg was one win away from playoffs and Guj is 2 time finalists. And if 4 teams have to qualify so obviously 6 teams won't and they'll appear weak so i don't even know what's your point. 
Rcb, Punjab, RR, SRh,CSM would all be considered better than those seasons and MI and DC would be worse so even then this season was more competitive"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,What about other 12 overs ? Having a kkr like bowling>>>>> 3-5 good performing bowlers
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Damn Chahal with 21 wickets and Watson with 20 wickets srsly RCB's bowling as well as fielding was also lit they were obsessed for trophy

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Bumrah was at his peak in 2019-20. Don't think any KKR batter would survive against him. MI had better batting too but yeah a lot would depend on how Russel would go. I'd still say Mi much better but if you take out Bumrah then it's 55-45 to KKR.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,i counted ur worst performance and gave -1 for it what's wrong with it idiot
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,">MI has sheer dominance over KKR 23>11

KKR won in the last 4 encounters fyi"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"because its not kkr vs mi, its kkr 2024 vs mi 2020 so relevant historical context for prediction in this case would only be performance of mi team in 2020 and that of kkr in 2024"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"kkr fast bowling is weaker than mi. all kkr fast bowlers went for around 10 economy and starc was hit out of the park even by bowlers in most matches. MI had two fast bowlers in top 3 wicket takers and all their pacers had economy under 8 except 1 who was 9. kkr fast bowling was very inconsistent which made almost lost them many matches which was saved by spinners and batters whereas for mi fast bowling made them won most matches, and when boult and bumrah were rested, srh defeated them with 10 wickets.

MI fast bowling is better than kkr hands down. kkr spin is much better than mi undoubtedly."

comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,RCB should have won that final honestly. Gayle and Kohli gave you guys a very good start. If only there was enough support in the middle. Ben Cutting literally f'd you guys up.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"No.
In the first league stage clash between kkr and Punjab, Punjab defeated Kolkata by 23 runs in match 15. Kkr stopped pbks on 132 but kkr's batting collapsed and could score only 109."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"2020 Narine is way different than 2024 Narine.
This year Narine has changed his technique and temperament....he has reduced blindly slogging and can now score runs like a normal batsman. That's why he scored a century this year against peak RR's bowling lineup."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,As I said in another comment..peak 19-20 Bumrah got smashed by Russell in the match where KKR scored a huge total of 232 and won by 34 runs. In that match peak Bumrah had economy of 11.00 with Zero wickets and 🐐 Malinga had Economy of 12.00 with Zero Wickets.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"How delusional, Salt and Narine scored at a better strike rate and average. Pollard is no Match to Russel. Russel can eat Pollard for breakfast. Also Rohit has played shit as a batter throughout the IPL, it's a shame to even compare him to Shreyas as a batter. 10th place suits apt for MI."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,This is not supposed to be a match-by-match calculation. No one did it for MI 2020 either you idiot
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"KKR Spin is better for Economy yes, But Play-off fast bowling of KKR was the best, Andre Russell especially, He had 19 wickets by the end of the series and he mostly only bowled 1-2 overs or sometimes 3, If he had bowled 4 overs he would've easily been on the purple cap no. 2 if not 1, And KKR didn't play 2 matches, If they had then the whole Purple cap leaderboard would be filled with KKR bowlers, All bowlers had 17+ wickets be it fast or spin, Mitchell Starc was playing IPL after years, Hence he wasn't comfortable at first, By the end, He was the one taking valuable wickets in Playoffs, Bumrah gets smacked by Manish Pandey, and Trent Boult gets smacked by Andre Russell, or Venky or Shreyas"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"I wonder why the KKR bowling is given so much credit, they’ve taken wickets yes but they’ve got tonked a plenty..
All this praise is just because of them bullying SRH."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,All teams play on the same pitches? KKR won on flat tracks and even slow tracks later in the season. And if batting stats of kkr are inflated then KKR's bowling stats are legendary by that parameter
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Exactly man I still can't believe that how tf we lost a win match even after getting a great start in powerplay could have chase it down in just 16 overs 💔
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Isi year ke Narine ki baat kr raha hu , boult aur boom ko ghanta maar pata wo lol , the match where Narine scored 100 bohot went for 7 economy, he can't do jackshit to legends of the game"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Russel has 126 sr and 14 avg against Bumrah and got out 4 times anyways the game you mentioned in the same game narine got smacked by Hardik too it's just a bad game.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,">Pollard is no Match to Russel. Russel can eat Pollard for breakfast.

Bro what💀 ( you kidding?)

>Also Rohit has played shit as a batter throughout the IPL, it's a shame to even compare him to Shreyas as a batt

6000 runs in IPL lol mom in 2 finals. Comparing tjat fraud iyer lol 💀

Didnt even start on captaincy lmao"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"Jitna downvote karna hai karlo, I agree ki Trophy jeetna is the most important but KXIP ofc had more points and only KKR could stop them, on the other hand KKR lost all the matches in their first half"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"we are not talking about playoff or league match or ipl of those two teams. just set of few matches. so one doing good in playoffs have zero value. the overall season is to be looked, and kkr pacers were bashed all around that they failed to defend 260 and went bucket load of runs in other matches. mi would thrash their pacers left and right. mi pacers will get narine in single digits. narine mostly can hit part timers or non-main pacers only. mi will easily beat kkr in flat pitches without much spin support. if pace of mi was not a beast, they would have not even got in playoffs, forget about 1+ NRR as their spin was zero."
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,Narine himself is a legend of the game....and okay if at all he gets out on Bumrah or boult..so what? KKR have many other batsmen too... especially Manish Pandey who has best stats against Bumrah.
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"KKR comeback was crazy, The RR vs KKR was 💀💀💀, 121 opening partnership, Ended at 150 💀, But when that comeback started, they became better than KXIP"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"See, First of all, Narine wouldn't be able to smash as much as he did this season against them yeah ok, But, If Mitchell Starc plays as he did in playoffs, He would thrash all of MI, You saw that perfect delivery to Abhishek Sharma right? Bumrah or Bolt can't do that, If Vaibhav Arora didn't give so many wides, He can thrash MI too, Overall KKR 2024 is a much better team than MI 2020, Their bowling attack was way better than MI, Yes you can say Pace of MI was better and it will be a long ass debate but In Spin KKR just reigned supreme, and MI had 0 good performing spinners in 2020, So KKR would just smash everyone other than Bumrah and Bolt and Manish Pandey and Russell would smash them too"
comment,The Comparison b/w two of the Greatest Team in an IPL season.,1000,"if starc performs as 2-3 matches in playoffs and others, mi will be rattled, but if he performs like 10 other matches, even our bowlers will thrash him like karn sharma did. kkr has only one pacer for fast pitches starc who we saw was thrashed in majority of matches, and russell and spinners will be as useless as mi spinners, so no difference. so overall boult, bumrah, Pattinson, all would rattle kkr batting. its literally 1 good bowler vs 3-4 good bolwers in fast pitches. no match at all."

A lot of matches in 2019 WC had an audience in the 8-9k range.

Gone are the days that stadiums would be filled to the brim, not the way sport is right now. Even in this world cup, the tickets were available from long back.

It's just a stick to beat India with. I mean, the 2023 WC had highest amount of attendance of any World Cup.

Just in case we win , i really want warner to get the orange cap the 4rth time in his last 5 seasons , he never gets the praise he deserves even though he has been amongst the top 3 ipl players of all time imo"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"I am sure both the fans are not confident of their teams for this game including me. Crazy injuries and over dependence on few stars.

That said, I see SRH more plays like a team with clearly defined roles without many super stars in those roles.

Last game toss played a role and looked like RCB team did their home work well for Saha and Kane's wickets.

Also, RCB might be forced for a swap for morris/saini injuries and there are chnaces the replcements can be quite good on their day like Lockie did to us.

Its either the team that implementing their plans well wins or some one like warner/kohli/ABD/Manish getting a blinder innings can tilt the scales in favour of 1 team.  Other wise I think it is a fair battle."

comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Honestly, I'd be still happy with SRH regardless of this match's outcome. Losing like that to KKIP and then beating 3 best teams of IPL to make it to play offs itself is not easy feat."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Imo SRH and RCB both are pretty much on the same page here. Both the teams are over reliant on their top 4, Holder and Morris are their only best option after that.

The advantage imo is with SRH coz of their bowling attack. Natarajan coming good has made them miss Bhuvi a lot lesser. While RCB have to hope Saini is fully fit for the big match. While the likes of Udana and Siraj should come good for them."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"All of y'all underestimating SRH too much you know, they are probably at their best form atm, whereas for RCB, they couldn't defeat this current DC side. No way RCB winning this unless we see a Kohli-ABD miracle today."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"As a SRH fan I feel, If it is in Sharjah we would have won easily. But Abu dhabi is helping Quicker bowlers and RCB have better fast bowlers for those conditions than SRH. Only way SRH can win is by individual brilliance of either Warner, Kane or Rashid. RCB are favourites IMO"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Got to open with Kohli, Abu Dhabi is a big ground, so Moeen Ali might be useful. 

RCB XI

Kohli, Padikkal, ABD, Moeen, Shahbaz/Gurkeerat,Morris,Udana, Sundar,Saini, Siraj, Chahal. 

For SRH Warner and Williamson will be key, their best bet will be chasing. 

SRH XI 

Warner, Saha, Williamson, Pandey, Garg/Abhishek Sharma, Holder, Samad,Rashid, Khaleel, Sandeep Sharma, Natarajan."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"I will play Finchy in this game. He is a big game player. He has experience. Can't leave a player of his stature out for such an important fixture. Also, if he clicks he can pull the game to RCB single handedly.."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,srh has always put a full stop to rcb's season's so I expect them to do the same today. srh all the way unless Virat/Ab step up.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Okay genuine question. I've seen support for Udana here, people saying that he should've played in the matches he wasn't in. What's so special about him? No disrespect to the player, but his performance hasn't been out of the ordinary so far."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"I'd say this for SRH. This would be a win toss- bat first situation for them. Runs on the board is always a huge advantage in playoffs, especially against a team like RCB. Dew or not, I feel that SRH have enough bowling to defend 170 odd, and we definitely have the batting to score that. And mind you, SRH is still pretty terrible at chasing this season. So yeah, bat first. 
For RCB, I'd say it would be a harder decision, for  several matches,nothing really has clicked for them in batting or bowling, so I'd say what they should do is not play in the strengths of the opposition, and bat first as well. If Siraj/Saini gets Warner early in a steep Chase, who knows they might have a chance
TLDR: Win toss bat first regardless of the dew."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Morris is most probably out, which would be a huge blow. No update on Saini either. We are literally out of bowlers. Probably will end up playing Moeen, or maybe give Steyn one last hurrah"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"We need Paddikal and Philippe to use the powerplay and make it to the 9th or 10th over, and for Kohli and AB to fire later on. Along with that, if we can finally use Siraj and Sundar in the powerplay, and save Morris, Udana and Chahal for later, we might have a chance of being able to win this one."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,The winner has to play 3 matches in 4 days. That's ridiculous.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,I feel AB needs to be there at the death overs because SRH bowl a lot of yorkers and he's very good at scooping and sweeping those kind of deliveries.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,SRH PP bowler is Sandeep and then Rashid comes on after PP. I don't see how Finch will survive and score runs in that case. Better to open with VK and reinforce middle order.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"We already came a long way qualifying to the playoffs even in this injury struck season sister. Even if we lose, I will be happy."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,No batting after 4
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"the 2020 effect seems to have worn off. dont worry, RCB will be back to its old self like DC (though I really want them to win the cup this year)"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,What about us. As SRH fans when bhuvi started the season well we were so happy. We had the bhuvi who used to take wickets in the PP and bowl well at the death. But we know what happened same with Mitch marsh and Vijay Shankar who are 1st team players and injured. Even we are just like you guys just happy to reach the playoffs. Given how angry virat is he'll probably smack us let right and center.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Warner never gets the attention he deserves man.. A man doesn't get an orange cap 3 times just like that.. Consistent af. But, among SRH fans he's given the utmost respect."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"he has a lot to prove since there are many players up for that title like kohli,raina,and especially gayle who has broken dozens of records in the ipl"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Lol no. SRH fans know they are the favorites and are doing their bit to reverse jinx. Observe and you'll find them doing it all the time.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"I think both teams have pretty solid bowling attacks. It’s just that SRH bowlers tend to be more slower while RCB bowlers tend to be more faster so on this particular sticky wicket, the SRH bowlers would probably fare better."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"I'd rather ask Dube and Moeen to bowl as many as they can. Without our two main bowlers we're gonna concede a shit ton of runs, might as well stack our batting"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Um... What did we do?

I rather saw MI fans going ""uh... SRH defeated MI A not MI, so they can suck it"" and all the unnecessary shit everywhere. What about that?"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,The Sunrisers have done exactly that in 2016. That's how beast Warner is
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Man that's what's I'm worried about with Natarajan lmao, dude bowls 5 Yorkers and 56 full tosses at brute players"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"*sister 😁
I was hoping for a finals finish for SRH but given our inconsistency I’m not sure. We’re very unstable. Luckily April isn’t too far away."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Both teams have no batting after 4, guess we’ll finally be able to prove whose is worse 💪"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Damn. Saini is our bestbowler and morris is the best all rounder. Idk why moeen ali is isn't playing. He is a good batsman , and can bowl too."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"You're way too pessimistic lol. SRH are on a 3 game win streak and RCB are on a 4 game losing streak and one of those games SRH chased RCB's total in 14 overs. I think SRH are pretty easily the 2nd best team in the playoffs even with the injuries. If top order can play well, you guys are genuine contenders."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"He would have gotten it in 2016( the only season he didnt get it in ) as well but rcb plays on chinnaswamy  and srh on the 2nd largest ground ig , that made the hundred run difference between him and kohli

7/14 games are on home ground"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,He easily beats Kohli and Gayle IF he wins now due to team accomplishments. And his personal accomplishments are better than Raina if he wins another
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Mate I know for a fact that either virat or abd will go crazy tonight and as an SRH fan I made peace with it. Just happy to be included in the playoffs.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,He should just clear his head and focus on his strengths because those deliveries are very difficult to hit. AB is talented enough to hit those deliveries but it is still a very tough thing to do (I remember Riyan and Tewatia did that perfectly). You guys also have Rashid.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Are you are trying to say Kohli is not good enough to make 900 runs a season unless he gets Chinnaswamy home ground ?
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,he's a goat ofc but im saying to be the greatest in the ipl you really need to prove your self above others to be the only goat.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"He's already won it once, Kohli and Gayle have never won it. And he carried us to the title and was the captain to boot. He's already ahead of them in terms of team accomplishments."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"I actually want all three of them to play, because it looks like Morris isn't fit. Finch, AB, Moeen and Philippe should play IMO. There is a risk though, Dube and Moeen will have to share 4 overs between themselves"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Bro. I've been in every thread the past week. It all started with SRHvMI post match thread where a lot of MI fans were saying that ""MI A"" shit which just came out pretty unnecessary and condescending. Like come on, your team rested players in their own accord and our team did their best against what's on their plate and came out on top. What's the need to do these?

Then I saw a comparison in yesterday's post match thread about similarities in SRH vs DC and yesterdays match, which basically was just showing how DC sucks at chasing. Then the next one was a highly upvoted ""not to rub it in, but SRH can SUCK IT"" comment by some MI fan.

Like come on, who's the toxic one here? Check both the threads and you'll see it yourself."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"First of all, no one is good enough to score 900 runs in one season. That's already crazy, and the fact that Virat has achieved it makes him Superhuman already

Secondly, YES. Big fat yes. It wasn't possible without Chinnaswamy. Playing 9/16 games on a flat pitch definitely was the major factor. Did you even see those hundreds vs GL and KXIP. That can't happen at other grounds"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"No

Infact rcb's bowling was probably the shittiest that season and he obviously didnt get to face his team's bowling , he was godlike that season

Just saying warner could have scored more if their home ground wasnt that big"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Uh, yes? The 900 was a massive outlier anyway. His highest total since that season is 530"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Uh... Robin uthappa won orange cap in 2014. KKR won that year.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Uthappa and KKR won it in 2014
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Um... How about 3 orange caps in 5 seasons and consistent 500+ scores since 6 years lol
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,I second this. Our pacers have been awful so might as well try spin. Spinners have been good recently(for all teams) even Shabaz was good in the last game. If the spinners are having a good game we might get 10-12 overs of spin and not rely on pacers plus moeen can add a bit of spine in the batting after number 4
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"MI fans are in a phase where they are slowly turning into CSK like fandom. Can't accept any criticism of their ""perfect"" team. Ignore them."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Watson and Chahal were in top 3 wicket takers with 20+ wickets despite Chahal playing just 13 games, I wouldn't call that shittiest. They were also missing Mitchell Starc coz of injury btw"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Gayle's 2011-13 peak was better than any IPL batsman ever
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Tf do i say lol , i praise kohli , u think im shitting your team , i talk about warner , u think im shitting on kohli"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Is this the conversation about who has the best peak or who has been best ever in IPL? And Warner scored 500+ runs for 6 seasons in a row and won 3 Orange caps. He is just as dangerous and far more consistent. I'm a huge fan of Gayle but he had quite a few bad seasons. Warner doesn't have a single bad season.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Philippe and padikkal have been good but slow which puts a lot of pressure on the guys coming in next. Dube has underperformed massively and sundar comes in with 4-5 overs left and isn't really suited to the finisher role
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,Dube Washi is not Hardik Pandya they can max hit one six and then out. They aren't the finishers you should be looking for.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Warner has been Most consistent for sure, but most destructive has been Andre Russell and Nobody even comes close to him in that regard."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"I was hoping for Moeen to be the finisher. Washi is just for worst case scenario. For Washi to come out we have to lose 6 wickets. He's not bad for a number 8.

I think some of the pressure can be relieved because there are still capable batsmen to come after Kohli and AB, so they don't play as cautiously."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,That's why I put them at 7 and 8. Hardik bats at 5 or 6
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"Again, we are talking about the best ever in IPL. I don't see why bring Russell into the conversation here? He is the best finisher in IPL but he isn't the best ever batsman. The only one who can come close to Warner is Gayle that's because even if Gayle's average is lesser his strike rate is more than Warner. But I still rate Warner over Gayle because of his number of match winning innings and consistency and the differece is still very less."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 Eliminator - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Royal Challengers Bangalore- SRH vs RCB,53,"I'm saying Russell has been the most destructive IPL player ever, more destructive than anyone else.

Most man of the match awards are with AB de Villiers though, Gayle is second on that list, Rohit 3rd and Warner and Dhoni tied on 4th."

comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,Man I really appreciate you making this. Saved me from the hassle of googling about the transfers. Thanks!
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"So, KXIP now have -

KL Rahul, Mayank Agarwal, Karun Nair, K Gowtham, J Suchith and Kumble as their coach. That K stands for Karnataka, methinks."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Has lewis been transferred to RR? Only saw the news informing  he was been released by MI.  


Also why did RR release gowtham? He was their only finisher candidate and was a handy all rounder ,the better teams would generally keep such players around to reap the rewards when they peak."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Man I'm so stoked for Rahane joining DC, this way we're going to have a prolific Indian power hitter in Rahane to follow Pant in the lineup.... Wait, Rahane is an opener?/s


Lol DC is fucking mental, what are we going to do with Rahane when we've got Shaw and Dhawan. I don't want to see Shaw sit out for an opening pair of Rahane and Dhawan."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,">DC:Out:- Sherfane Rutherford, Jagadeesha Suchith, Trent Boult, Mayank Markande, Rahul Tewatia || In:- Mayank Markande, Ravichandran Ashwin

Mayank Markande was transferred from DC to.......DC?"
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"FML! Rajasthan will have 5 leg spinners in their squad next year if I am not wrong. Shreyas Gopal, Markande, Tewatia, Ish Sodhi and S Midhun. Unless they're releasing Sodhi and Midhun, this makes zero sense."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Man as a MI fan,I don't get excited for IPL in even years.2021 should be fun"
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,I wish that SRH would have got Gautam. He can bowl and is a good finisher and is an Indian. Very disappointed with them not going for him.
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,As an MI fan I love the even year IPLs. I can just relax and wait for the REAL season to begin in 2021.
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,And Kohli had already started talking about trades during their last match itself.  But no news of RCB yet.
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Marakhande Tewatia trade isn't confirmed it seems, can't find much about it on any of trustworthy sites like Cricbuzz or cricinfo nor have any of the teams tweeted about it."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"The only sense I can make out of Delhi going for Rahane is that the batting struggled in home games due to the slow pitch, so they want an accumulating batsman like Rahane. They already had Vihari to try out for that role though. :("
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"With the trade of Siddesh Lad, KKR also entered the party. SRH and RCB management is on a holiday I reckon"
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"What has DC done? Rahane wont sit out and now one of Shaw,Iyer or Pant will move places in the batting order to accommodate him. RR had already dropped him down to 5/6 and even from the team and our brain dead team management thinks its a good idea to have him. Only role I can see him play is of an anchor and that too only in home games, if he is playing away games batting at 4/5 for DC or worse opening then its better to surrender the game before a ball is bowled. Man my blood is fucking boiling."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Lost interest in IPL 2 or 3 years ago :-(. Game of money, not cricket."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,Completely fucked their batting order and now probably Shaw will pay for it by sitting out or playing out of position. SMH
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Even from RR POV, Butler and Stokes are going to leave IPL mid-way (to join their test Squad). Will be interesting to see how they are going to balance it out."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,Nice to see them signing some bowlers for once... Trent Boult available? Nah we'll stick with Siraj thanks

comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Lamichhane is still there. Even though he is a foreigner, he should make it into the team when needed easily since the batting is mostly Indian."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,Lewis to RR is Yet to be confirmed. A few reports says he is going to be released while Kulakarni's deal is purely cash
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,Wankhede is a graveyard for spin. Especially in t20s because the ground is tiny. Also Rahul Chahar played much better last year. Chahar and krunal should be enough to fill the spin bowling quota. And you have jayant yadav too.
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"I think i understand what you're saying, We mostly needed a good foreign batsman because Ingram wasn't performing that well. Now with rahane, shaw, dhawan and munro we'll have to settle for 2 openers and drop others or change the batting order. I understand why Shaw is rated very highly for his age but last season apart from almost scoring that 100, he was below average tbh."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,He isn't uncapped. Made his T20 debut last year

comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,You mean 2019?
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"then maybe you should probably add Rahane to DC and as per reports Lewis isn't traded to RR, he is being released from MI. Kulkarni is traded with cash."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"The thing is either we drop one of Shaw or Rahane and since we just traded in Rahane its not going to be him. Next year we have another mega auction where players will be retained. It would be ideal if we play Shaw the whole season as we will mostly be retaining him next season but now because of this stupid trade we will move him out of position to accommodate Rahane and probably before the end of the season end up dropping him. We could be retaining Pant, Iyer and Shaw as our core 3 batsman who will play for us for years to come but with Rahane here all that goes down the drain."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Still would have been a good backup and his auction price was just 20L. I am not really that concerned cause we usually plan our stuff so maybe we have already found some unknown young legspinner in domestic, if not then we are definitely going for Karn Sharma if CSK release him which they probably would. Karn did really well for us in 2017."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Given how amazing Rabada was last season and how he plays this season, I feel we should retain Iyer, Pant and Rabada."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"its usually 3 retentions + 2 RTM in the auction so I agree and the 5 couldve been Shaw, Iyer, Pant, Rabada and for the 5th it couldve been Dhawan if he was cheap enough or whoever is going to be our big buy this season or even Ashwin now. This Rahane transfer has really changed the whole dynamics of the team."
comment,IPL 2020 Confirmed Transfers,179,"Tail-end of the last season he played really well. 3D on the other hand, smh!"

* Support for 4 screens. So 4 people can share the cost, making it much cheaper.

* No ads. The ₹899 plan has ads

* 4k streaming. ₹899 is 1080p only and the less said about mobile plan the better.

I'd actually love an even higher tier plan if they can provide high quality sports. Currently it's 1080p 25fps which looks stuttery and pretty bad compared to DTH (1080i 60). 1080p 60 would be great."

But at 499/year, you also get all the Marvel shows and movies, HBO content and a whole lot of shows and movies, albeit only on your mobile in addition to India matches, IPL, EPL, ISL, F1 and French Open.

Best part- No Ads!!
The only problems are that you can use only your mobile device and not in full HD.

Also a schedule of upcoming live events would be nice. As of now the only way is to go and search live for events that are currently live. There is no way of knowing what is coming up.

You can log into 4 devices but can stream only on 2 devices at a time..

If you can use upto 4 devices simultaneously, then it'll be 375/head (1499/4) which i cheaper than VIP service (399/head) provided by hotstar currently.. So there is no way hotstar is gonna provide you with streaming on 4 devices simultaneously..

Yeah rn there is no restriction wrt to logins. My VIP account is logged into 5 devices..

About the 1499/year plan, if we can stream on 4 devices simultaneously, then choosing this plan is a no-brainer (375/head). It's even cheaper (while having a lot more benefits) than mobile plan (499/head). That's why I'm skeptical about 4 devices at a time.."
comment,"Disney took advantage of the record viewership of IPL 2020 and 21, and have increased the price of hotstar (watching on non-mobile devices is even more expensive or has less quality)",171,"Look at Netflix. They have 2 screen for 649 and 4 screens for 799. Pricing is a always a bit complicated and it is not straightforward as you are thinking.

For starter you always get discount for buying in bulk. Second if you take family as a unit most families will only buy 1 subscription regardless of how many screens they may be using it on. But if you can get one more screen for a minuscule price people will throw in that extra amount. However they are very unlikely to get 2 subscriptions just because more than 2 people are watching at a time. That is how human behavior works.

Then if only one person has an account then it is easier for hotstar to have billing and everything with one person than multiple people. If Disney was going after subscriber numbers it would be different but they are not chasing VC funding so they don't care about those numbers.

There are more reasons but giving 4 screens at lower rate per screen is totally consistent with all the pricing decisions I have seen."

Woah never knew that it was 649 for 2 screens. Why would anyone subscribe to 649 plan lol

Yeah hotstar FAQ confirmed that we can stream on 4 devices simultaneously.. Now I feel like 1499/year (375/head) is the ideal price set by hotstar and other two plans are just expensive and people shouldn't go for it.."

Half of the team is already strutting around like they would be anywhere else but on the field.

Chahar, Du Plessis, Curran and Rayudu were the only ones with intent.

The last thing you need at this point is to know that management doesn't care about you and will cut you out even if you are 'Mr IPL'.

On the other hand, this could be a leak with the intent to destabilize CSK. I mean, their CEO said no comments. So clearly it was not CSK who released this news."

Doubt it. Harbhajan has played 100+ tests and both were part of the WC2011 winning team.

comment,"IPL 2020 : CSK to terminate all contractual relationship with Harbhajan Singh, Suresh Raina",206,Honestly he is fit to play for much longer. Just depends what he feels up in his head. Whether he's exhausted or he wants to commit to his army duties or whether he has the hunger to play cricket. Even if he doesn't make it as a player he could be useful as a member of the support staff in the CSK dressing room.

comment,"IPL 2020 : CSK to terminate all contractual relationship with Harbhajan Singh, Suresh Raina",206,I agree things shouldn't be taken to the media but Raina never did that. Issue with Dhoni rumor was spread by someone from CSK management. Srinivasan threatened him afterwards and took his words back. Raina only thanked CSK and said nothing bad to media.

Or say that to a 37-yo Tendulkar, who just made the first ODI double 100, most probably top scored for his IPL franchise, and stroked two of the finest test centuries of the last decade (in SA) in 2010. Say that to a 36-yo Ross Taylor, who's still going strong, and hopes to play the 2023 world cup. Say to Shane Warne, that a 38-yo player had no business leading RR in 2008.

Raina definitely wants to get back that's why he's refraining from saying anything in media to not complicate things further.i m pretty sure dhoni would have asked Srini to keep the rant down after the initial comments. 
Pretty sure the issue is between dhoni and raina and not between raina and management, in every team captain enjoys additional benefits other than players such as more pay , lodging , flight tickets etc..it's not uncommon in sports"

comment,Fastest balls in IPL 2020. Archer is the lone wolf as of now.,254,">Definitely a speed gun bug.


Boy.. ya can't say ""definitely"" so causally.. without knowing anything for a fact. That's just your opinion.



Sure,   Speed gun bugs happen. But it's also not surprising that a 6'7 Windies bowler hurling down a random 90mph delivery. 



Holder doesn't bowl faster only because he doesn't want to bowl faster. He relies on his crazy swing and seam control, which has made him one of the best bowlers in the game right now. Top 5, actually.. and he's also an All Rounder who can bat really well. 

There's a data where it shows how Holder also gets the most swing out of any bowler in the game. 



If Holder wants to, he definitely can bowl ""faster"".. For someone that size, it won't be hard at all. But Holder is a smart lad.. just like McGrath was. Abusing your strength is always the best way to go. Style points and the speed gun is irrelevant. Superficial nonsense 



The ""speed"" on the speed gun also changes based on the type of delivery.. and pitch conditions."

comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"10-20% depending on the board is paid to the cricket board.(Players have negotiated different percentage in their contract with their board for allowing them to play IPL).

After that, taxes. If you arrive fully fit in the IPL you get paid half the salary whether you play or not. After that different method to pay them the money by matches played(nobody has a clear idea).

This year they will be paid match fees too and if you play the entire group stage without missing any games, there is additional money that you will get. But that is from this year."
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"Check the final match scorecard, I think that is enough to justify the price tag. Big man rising up on big occasion. Though, apart from that he had avg tournament."
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"I'd say definitely yes. Lackluster in the early group stage games, sure, but paid off big time towards the end, especially in the knockouts."
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"At the end,yes. The price may not have been justified as such,but he had a big role in helping KKR win their 3rd trophy."
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,He only had 2-3 good matches the entire season. And fortunately those were the qualifiers and finals.
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"He was still living off the 2017 season hype. I remember him being 2nd highest in Purple Cap rankings,and he played around 3-4 matches fewer than Bhuvi."
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,Whats the scenario in which you are assuming this will happen? GT will do a RTM on shankar for 3 crores and PBKS will raise it to 30?
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"Iirc Ashwin was captain for 2018 and 2019 so he definitely knew the potential of Varun but sadly Punjab being Punjab released him after one bad season and he has never looked back after going to KkR

Also they got KL Rahul and Mayank in 2018 and they got Varun, Arshdeep, Shami, and Pooran in 2019

Hindsight is crazy but still imagine if they kept their core around these same players till today 

While Mayank hasn't been in form for a while, he also was doing so well before PBKS made him captain and he started playing at 4 to give others opportunities"
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,He got injured after 1 game and never played again for PBKS
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,He played reasonably well against Rcb too (in 2016 finals)
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,Truth be told kkr won because of their insane batting and starc turning up in playoffs was a pleasant surprise kkrs bowling was ineffective in extremely flat pitches case in point the match against pbks.
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,I watched that one in the stadium here in Delhi. He became my favourite player just off of that one innings. I also remember him falling down while bowling against KKR that same year
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"The salary cap has gone up from last season, by like 30% so I think you are right that it will be higher than my numbers given I haven't and can't really take salary caps into account. It is interesting though that every three years there is a distinct drop in max price from the previous two and then it rebounds the following year. Starc was a massive variation from the mean, but historically you might expect a drop to a little below the max 2023 purchase price. Presumably the increase in salary cap will counteract this though. The other alternative is that max salary paid in a season has little, potentially zero, bearing on what the max salary is the next season haha. Still, a fun way to east the first 20 minutes at work."

comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"I remember the auction, KKR had only 7 players up until then and a purse of 20 crore, they bid till 10.5 for Pooran, just imagine, if they had bought him, some 9 or 10 crore to fill the rest of the slots(10 players minimum). Same when tim david came, had about 10 crores and went till 7 or 7.5 for him. Mad bidding man"
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"That it did, I completely understand Kishan and was making a joke for that, but Jofra seriously turned our fortunes, he didn't play 1 year and was mediocre the next, there went our bowling attack where it was all Bumrah and inshallah more or less, won't complain tho, we made playoffs and currently have the Best core retained"

comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"Yup, truly a L moment, past 4 years have been blunder after blunder leading up to Hardik Rohit Drama

But looks like we'll move on, we'll definitely see a la Bumrah and Boult, maybe Shami, Bhuvi, Arshdeep, or maybe Strac, Anderson, Rabada

Any of those pairs are pretty good"
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,"By developing your ability to detect sarcasm.

I am bloody dyslexic and neuro-divergent i am part of the target group tone tags are for but even i can tell that had no intent of being serious.

As helpful as tone tags are you need to still get better at detecting stuff yourself because not everyone would participate in it and truth be told it does kinda ruins the joke at times.

The more you practice the better you will get at detecting this stuff which would help for future, that's basically how i have gotten lile 60% good at it.

And also this subreddit isn't always for serious discussion the area which describes the subreddit has the word ""banter"" in it. You can't just expect serious stuff from a subreddit that's also offering banter, this place is both for jokes and serious discussion and more so the jokes being in replies rather than in the form of memes which distinguishes this from something like r/cricketshitposts."
comment,"As 2025 IPL Mega Auction takes place, here's the most expensive player at each IPL auction",800,All you need is 3-4 solid picks for 5cr each and one major buy at 10-13cr and MI will be strongest on paper next year.  Good luck old nemesis 🫡

I have lost a lot of money after that though lol.,37,"I think Deepak Chahar will trouble Narine a lot in the powerplay, also it's unlikely for him to score in three consecutive games. Theekshana bowled really well in the previous match and I think he'll continue his form today in Chepak where historically off break bowlers do pretty well. But again, like I said after the big win I have lost a lot of money and now I'm taking a break from dream11 so take everything I say with grain of salt and do not trust what I say. I am NOT an expert."

comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"Delhi need to put in big performance if they want to beat MI. The Delhi batsman really need to come to the party. Bcoz with the strong batting line up that Mumbai have, Delhi bowlers won't be able to do anything unless batsman do their job properly. Really hoping one of Iyer or Pant goes BIG today."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,If Prithvi Shaw dosen't fire in the playoffs every Indian fan would be disappointed in him. An average of 22 for a player of that calibre and hype just doesn't do justice.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"The best chance for DC is to bat first with Rahane opening to shield Shaw from Boult and try to score 175+. If MI bats first, I doubt they'd win."

comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"People give koach a lot of shit for his batting , but atleast he consistently scores the most runs for rcb in the season , where as Rohit has a very average ipl record for a player is the second most paid in the tournament"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"Big advantage to whoever wins the toss first because of dew. Team defending total will have to play very well to win. Hope Rohit eats his lucky vadapav today and Nita ""Hanuman Chalisa"" Ambani helps our luck."

it's been an interesting tournament to watch. (probably the first one I followed in its entirety) odds show MI in slight favour but it's gotta be a good fight to watch."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,Mumbai already start as favourites. I just want the team to put up a good fight even if we lose. A one sided game here would mean shoulders dropping again and this team finds it very hard to come out of holes.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"This game has Qdk or Rohit 100 written all over it.
Dhawan has already completed his quota for the tournament"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"DC and MI's bowling is the best in the tourney. The thing that seperates them is the batting and MI definitely have a way better batting than DC. So to win this, DC will have to bowl their hearts out today. Winning the toss would give them a huge advantage as always."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,Only way DC has a chance in this is if they let Pant wear his Delhi Daredevils kit from 2018 xD
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"Yep, we have the accumulators in Dhawan, Rahane firing, need the explosive players like Shaw, Pant to finally get a big one, even Stoinis has been underwhelming after the brilliant first half"

comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"> MI's bowling attack this season is just Brutal

They look thoothless once a pair goes on to make a big partnership. Happened vs RR and SRH. The formula for DC would be to not lose wickets in PP at average RR and one of the openers(/top 3) to finish the game. DC openers have been hit and miss though so the early wickets will be the key."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"On paper, yes both teams are equally balanced. But our players are ridiculously out of form, although we saw some semblance of it coming back during the RCB game. Hope it stays."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"Agree with everything but 55-45 for finishing nah. Polly krunal and ncn(80 in wc) is a much better finishing lineup than stonius and axar and ash. 

And yeah 70-30 middle order is mad unfair. 60-40 would have been somewhat better"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"70-30 seems a bit brutal. I know Kishan is in a good form, but if you are giving so much priority to form, neglecting the fact that Iyer and Pant have better experience, then you should also keep in mind that Hardik hasn't been in his best form either. So I guess 60-40

Other matchups seem fine, probably Delhi go 55-45 in pace attack, as Pattinson/NCN have been struggling a bit"
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"MI's top 3 should get like 70-30 compared to DC, QDK and SKY are in brilliant form."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"The more balls a batsman wastes at a low strike rate, more he is costing his team. Scoring 40 runs in 35 balls just helps the opposite team more than your own team."
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,Am I missing something or koach's role in rcb is different (Virat and abd are the batting line-up in rcb) and Rohit's role is different(Rohit has been batting up and down the order some times no.4 now as opener) yet they all have more than 5000 runs they have been doing good job what's needed by them.

comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,It's more to do with who wins toss and how much dew will be there. The trend of batting second teams winning is becoming more and more apparent day by day.
comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"Pandya has been good in this season. 240 runs in 12 games with avg of 34 and SR of 175 is very good for a number 5.

Yeah 70 - 30 looks brutal but it's because of Pandya's good form and Pant's average performance and slow SR  in this season. Also, Iyer has not been same in the second half."

comment,Pre-match thread - IPL 2020 1st Qualifier - Mumbai Indians vs Delhi Capitals - MI vs DC,99,"If you only counted the performance in the last RCB game as ""recent form"", then yeah.

Sponsoring 6s and time outs? No, I'm good thanks."
comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"It took them 40+ years to accept ODI as a legitimately interesting and a skillful format. They aren't down with T20s and especially franchise version just yet.

Obviously, not everyone but there are plenty in England with the old-fashioned mentality, and many of them are quite influential (former cricketers, journalists, analysts, MCC member types). Even many fans on this sub have a very snobbish outlook towards anything except Test cricket.

Plus, the English have very high standards of what is considered tasteful. Look at Wimbledon - uniforms need to be plain white with no corporate logos. Things like cheerleaders, corporate brand names of events like ""Carbon Kamal smart catch of the match"", celebrities attention whoring, tacky team names, glittery uniforms, players show boating, etc are something that really turn them off. I'm not a fan of those either but to me they are easy to ignore as I focus on the actual cricket (which is of very high quality and intensity). But to others these are huge distractions."

But yeah, IPL hasn’t yet hit the level of a top football league or the NBA, where someone in a different hemisphere will support ManUtd or LA Lakers. I could see it happening in 30-40 if years if the sport continues to grow outside India."
comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"Ya even as an Indian I find it hard to care about any of the IPL teams though I watch it casually because I am a huge cricket fan. I wonder how the EPL teams developed such huge fan following world wide. 

I can see that today's kids are super excited about their respective IPL teams. May be this is what they call generation gap."
comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,I'm Indian and I still can't get any attachment to any team. When Sachin played I just watched MI's matches but now I only see the highlights of 'close fought' contests and only watch the knockouts/finals live.

comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,There’s a massive gap between thinking plastering everything in sponsors and having cheerleaders is a bit naff and not accepting T20 as a format.

comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"Maybe, just maybe, because it is the only cricket competition, that is on par/above standard, that directly conflicts with the county cricket season. I know for a fact that it is a good watch, but counties and county members don’t like when their players seemingly swan off to play on another tournament during the season. 

See Tom Banton missing BWT final, or Chris Jordan being paid by Sussex all year, furlough and all, to only play 2 games this year then disappear off for £320k."
comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"The players who get big pay days from the IPL like it...because they get a load of cash. Not sure who you mean by “key people in the ECB” but I assume you mean the ones who are getting really rich from Cricket TV revenues.

As an English Cricket fan it’s a meaningless thrash fest that doesn’t come close to the tension of test cricket and distracts our best players from developing their capability in test matches. 

Sorry, I know that’s going to be an unpopular opinion but I thought it might shed some light on the question."

comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,The IPL is probably the most popular but I think the BBL and the CPL are better but that's just my opinion.
comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"Exactly. But further to my point, I'm a big sports fan but the teams/leagues I follow from other countries are the ones that don't have an equivalent professional league here (regardless of quality)

NFL, NBA, MLB I love, but it's hard to care about the MLS, or even bundesliga or la Liga, or the NRL or bbl in Australia

Is the IPL better than the vitality blast? Good God yes. Do I care who wins it? No. Cos it won't mean as much as lancs winning the blast. Not for a long while yet.

comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"Indeed. the T20 format was invented in England and sprang up in all the other cricket playing countries. I am not sure who the ‘them’ is either. Has every single fan, player and journalist been canvassed and given their opinion."
comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"Yes but there's a difference between invention and acceptance.

England has 6 players in top 150 in terms of ODI matches played. 

From the time the first ODI was played (5 Jan 1971), English players have 25 spots in top 150 for Tests played. 

What does this mean? Their stars don't even care about playing in the format. It was just seen as an experimental side thing that you play as a youngster until you're good enough to say no and only play ""real cricket"".

Take KP for example. He was a fantastic player in all formats. In the he made international debut till he retired internationally, England played 118 Tests and he played 104 of them. In ODIs? He played 140 out of 206. It's not like Cook who was kind of a Test specialist. KP is a bonafide great and would walk into any side in the world in ODIs during that time.

AB? 228 out of 271 ODIs and 114 out of 133 Tests during his time. 

Clarke? 245 out 337 ODIs and 115 out of 144 Tests

All great players who started their careers around the same time. Yet KP has such a huge difference in the portion of games across formats while the other two are pretty consistent. 

England has always treated ODIs like how teams today treat T20i bilaterals. Stars sitting out, all sorts of players and lineups experimented with. Not including current players (who absolutely do take pride in excellence in shorter formats), the highest run scorer scorer for England in ODIs all time was Ian Bell with 5416 runs. There are 11 Indians, 9 Sri Lankans, 12 Australians, 11 Pakistanis, 9 South Africans, 9 West Indians, 6 New Zealanders, 3 Bangladeshis and 4 Zimbabweans ahead of him in career runs."

Morgan and Strauss have outright said they made a conscious effort to let players to go to the IPL to improve their white ball game under competitive and pressure situations."
comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"Internationals are separate from domestic for me. Otherwise why even bother with the Ranji and Shield seasons? .

There is a pretty big gap between IPL and other teams imo. The IPL has all the top players from all the leagues plus Indians (who don't play anywhere else) and minus Pakistanis. Pakistan has some very talented players that the IPL misses out on but there are way more Indians by sheer number to replace that quality. Basically, I don't see the Sixers beating Mumbai over a season. This does get tricky to judge tho because multiple players play for different teams. How do you even have a matchup between TKR and KKR? That's why I'd say the IPL has the highest quality in general because they have the most number of high quality players out of all the leagues."
comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"Everyone is entitled to their opinion obviously but the IPL provides the highest quality for me because it's Indian. India by sheer numbers has a higher amount of quality domestic players to fill in the local gaps compared to other leagues. Not saying Other countries don't produce good talent, they just can't compete with the number of players a nation with 1 billion people can produce. So on average, each IPL team is stronger for me which leads to a higher level of competition."

comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"Plain numbers of people means little compared to so many other factors. Otherwise India and China would be the best at every sport. But they aren't.

comment,CricViz writer Ben Jones on IPL 2020 excitement,196,"It's not just plain numbers tho. It's a nation obsessed with cricket and the IPL gives the poorest of kids a shot at earning life changing money. No other country has that kind of incentive. That pushes the quality. In cricket, India is close to being the best. 

It definitely overshadows the other leagues in terms of sheer exposure but there is a reason why it's easier to market. It's just at a higher quality and it includes an entire nation's (the single largest viewership of the sport) players that don't play anywhere else. The other leagues are very high quality and entertaining but even the cricketers themselves hold the IPL as the standard for domestic T20 competitions."

CSK-3(avg 8.199)

DC-2(avg 8.6825)

RR-2(avg 8.8205)

MI-1(8.199)

Best bowler for the remaining sides:

RCB-Saini 10.122

KKR-Sunil Narine 10.151

PK-Mohammad Shami 11.013

Few Notes: 

CSK usually played on pitches that very much suited their bowling attack.It will not happen this year so they have a tougher task ahead of them

2 of SRH's 4 bowlers are not in their first XI.

RCB for some reason let go of one of the best death bowlers in IPL and have a slower untested Kyle Jamieson in his place

PK have addressed their problems with 2 aussie untested pacers. Let's see how it goes."

comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,"Team by team analysis :

***MI*** \- There death bowling is majorly overrated and will be carried by Bumrah throughout the season. Boult will most probably return to his 2019 IPL form where the conditions will help the opponents bully him . Milne had last played in Indian condition way back in 2016-17 where he was getting thrashed. All in all teams need to bully MI's attack like RR's one man army .

***KKR*** \- Worst death bowling unit in the Ipl this year

***RCB***\- On paper their attack was looking like the worst one in Ipl but statistically they are in the top 5 death bowling units with siraj and saini growing and learning every year.

***RR***\- Stastically their attack is the best in IPL , but their luck has striked again . Archer has just got some major injury and might take a lot of time to get into his usual form (probably the entire season) , Morris is giving some serious competition to bhuvi in terms of who breaks down faster . 

***SRH***\- The most lethal bowling attack this IPL.

***CSK***\- Their bowling is the worst bowling attack after KKR considering they are playing in Wankhede it will be even worst.

***PBKS***\- They are giving some serious competition to KKR and CSK in terms of who looks the worst on paper. There bowling has no leader and wicket taker which will bite them back yet again.

***DC*** \- Although many of you will be inclined towards DC considering how good nortje was but it is still not certain if nortje can do the same magic here in the indian conditions."

comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,"16-20

Dhoni uses spinners in death sometimes. However, I think that he uses Jadeja when he primarily wants to clean up the tail; Jaddu is pretty good at that iirc. It might be a misleading stat as it doesn't take into account which batsmen he bowls to.

But yes, Jadeja can fire in those yorkers sometimes lol. Think Kohli should use him more overseas in tests to clean up the tail; he did that really well in the Sydney test in the first innings."

comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,It was the 84 game. KKR didnt bowl at the death as RCB chased down the target in 13.3 overs.
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,"Lol no😂 6.25 in WI, 5.63 in BD, 4.67 in Aus. So? Sample size is really small. Not bowled more than 10 overs in any of these countries. Don't worry about Boult. He will be very confident this year after the amazing last IPL he had. MI team culture and Rohit's aggressive captaincy and fine tactics have done him a world of good."
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,well morris' strike rate have been boosted bcoz of his 2016 stint and i have not yet witnessed any major knock from him except that one .. Kyle was bowling in the nz grounds where even an edge flies over for a six . Hesson has been pretty good at extracting the best outta the players and knows jamieson pretty well .. i advice let's just wait for the ipl to commence
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,"Lol no😂 as if Boult was club cricketer before joining MI , and MI and Rohit made him international level."
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,"Well by that logic boult also bowls in smaller nz grounds and his ipl record in India is mot that good either, it would take a huge effort from kyle to do what morris did for rcb"
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,He said CSK doesn't have any pacer who is good at death but they've Ngidi who was good for them at the death. Not sure how your logic fits here
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,But that hasn’t happened in 13 years and CSK has won 3 times out of 11 and 10/11 times in playoffs. So chances of CSK playing well are more as compared to RCB.
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,2016 lol
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,"Lol no😂 I mean his best came under MI and people here are talking about Boult as he is some club bowler, and not equivalent to Mitchell Starc."
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,Idt you understood my comment. I just said no ifs and buts are allowed. Not picking any team in particular. The guy said if ngidi performs. But yeah *if*
comment,Death Over Economy Of Bowlers In The Last Three Ipl Seasons ( 2018-2020),92,"Exactly, my point may be proven later, RCB desperately needed someone like Morris at the death and the management decided to drop him and thought they'd be able to get him for a cheaper price but they embarrassed themselves at the auction. RR, apart from archer were struggling at the death and Morris will make their attack much more stronger now."

comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"This may be an unpopular opinion but I want SRH to release/trade Williamson. We already have 4 solid options for the top 3 in Warner, Bairstow, Guptill and Pandey. Removing Williamson would mean searching for a different captain but sticking with him would unnecessarily complicate things.

Without Williamson, we can even afford to have a foreign batsman as a finisher like Maxwell or Morgan (I'm pretty much dreaming, yes) if Nabi stays out of the XI. Playing Nabi is fine too."

According to 2019 squad, they really need to fill up those missing places. These players lack either because of foreign players limit or because there's no suitable player for this role"
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,We have 5.3cr and additional 3cr added to auction purse. We will be releasing shakib for sure since he was banned and he played only 3 matches in the previous ipl. So we have enough money to buy middle order player and an alrounder.
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,Feel Robbie will fare much better for a different franchise. Assuming he'll get the chance to open the innings.
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,Not a SRH fan but it would be better to trade Williamson rather than release him. SRH could easily get one great if not two domestic batsman.
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"I believe they should do either of the following-

1. Trade Williamson for a good Indian player+cash. We bought him for like 3.2Cr and he delivered 3 times that amount.
2. Keep Kane but as a backup option incase Warner gets injured. Don't include him in playing 11. Who can captain SRH if Warner is injured and even cover the gap he creates? Bhuvi didn't do a gr8 job with captaincy last year and Kane has already proven himself to shine under warner's absence. Drop Guptill and another overseas player like Shakib to create more room for auctions. We would need another overseas batsmen as a backup anyway."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,Williamson is the captain that got us to finals in the year that Warner (then captain and our most important player) was banned. He's not going anywhere.
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"thing is, we can't afford to have more foreign players unless we decide to let someone go. I'd prefer it if we release Williamson (it hurts but still) as it would make room for the aforementioned players. It'd mean looking for a different captain but the decision would have more pros than cons in the long run imo."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,RR did not think 8.5 crore was enough so they released him in order to buy him for 10 crore in the auction.

comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"Beats me ..

No idea where they are gonna play Rahane 
Unless their plan is to replace Iyer as capt although he was amazing"
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"Oh well we released Alzarri the one-match wonder

Think we might regret releasing Behrendorff. Dude was ferocious with the new ball in the one or two games he played at the Wankhede."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"Seems counter intuitive, but I agree about releasing Stokes. The Jaipur and subcontinental pitches in general do not suit him but I would not play Livingstone. I think domestic batsmen are more easily available and RR needs a death bowler along with Archer. Both Unadkat and Aaron are not capable. A foreign bowler capable of bowling at the death might be a good buy. Livingstone is also kind of a one trick pony."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"We saw how Ashwin lead KXIP. Iyer gave much better results. Maybe have Ashwin as the vice captain. Also, Rahane doesn't want to captain. Look at his increase in performance after he was sacked."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"I mean if they want to keep a single overseas all rounder, I'd have CdG over Stoinis most of the times."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"DC fan... releasing him will give us 11 crores, can buy him back or someone else for lesser"
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"A good indian leg spin alrounder is a good option to have. If rashid gets injured, a local alrounder would be a good option and we can use the foreign slot for a player which suits the need."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,Funnily enough I'd think Maxwell would be pretty good for RCB but they need to go for a quality bowler
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,That’s a very good point. Williamson is in high demand and SRH should make use of that in the next trade window.
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"He is definitely going. Even if he stays for one more year, he will don a different jersey after the mega auction. Assuming that the rules of retention are still the same, teams will only be able to retain/RTM two overseas players, who will almost certainly be Warner and Rashid. 

Now Kane will get a lot of money in the auction this time, because he's a proven player in Indian conditions now, and I highly doubt SRH will pay 6-8 crores for a guy who may not even be in the first XI."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"Warner should lead the side next season. It’s hard to release Williamson, but I guess that’s the right way to go. Can’t have 3 foreign players as the top 3 batsmen in the order. Spoils the balance of the side. Pandey showed last season that he’s the perfect fit at 3."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,For 21 crores this time.
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,For me it'd still be stoinis. I feel he's more calm and composed than cdg. He did pretty well imo in last season (numbers might not necessarily reflect that though)
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,He's been in good form always but it hasn't translated to ipl performance. If they release stoinis they might target neesham and retain Cdg but seems unlikely.

Missing dhawan is unfortunate.
I know manish and Shankar haven't played to the expectations but they are rated high.
Cant  blame much on lower order as middle order didn't play to the expectations and lower order was not able to play freely.
We had yuvi few years ago.
Not all domestic buys are bad."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"CDG was decent in IPL 2018, and Stoinis was decent last year. Imo they should retain both of them one last time, and then get rid of the underperformer in the mega auction."
comment,IPL 2020 Player Release and Retention Thread,65,"Yes, he played barely any matches, but don't think he underperformed. It's just that Chahar nailed his spot, and Thakur wasn't particularly bad, so Dhoni didn't want to drop him. I believe Dhoni still trusts Mohit as he has worked with him before."

Here's this previously oblivious Englishman's opinion:   :)

This exposes an alleged exploitative, manipulative corporation who seem to be prepared to bend facts to silence dissent.

Secondly this seems to expose holes in India's legal system.   The biggest take away from this is that India's whistleblowing laws are seriously lacking and weighted heavily towards corporations, and heavily against individuals."

comment,How do you feel about BYJUs Logo on the Indian Cricket team's T-shirt? They filed a $2.75M defamation case over me.,3993,"I remember a couple of years ago, when I was in 9th grade I downloaded byju's, signed in with my number and all and used it for a few days, after which they started calling me, A LOT. It was basically them trying to get me into buying the subscription. I was dumb back then and they were like, hey we'll send a guy to your house for a trial, I asked mom and she reluctantly agreed. Then, after a few days, the guy came at 8 pm and was trying his best to convince me and my parents to buy it, and I did get convinced tbh. My parents were like, this costs way too high and all, and then after failing to negotiate, he left, AT FUCKING 11 PM, I had a fucking exam the next day, which I barely passed. But yeah, we did not buy the subscription, and I am so fucking happy for that. My uncle, who is an engineer, called me later when he got to know about this, and he said "" Never ever use Byju's"" cause he probably knew about what they were doing. 

I know there's no point to this, and also know that I suck at storytelling. It is just an incident related to Byju's that happened to me.It's just that they'll do anything to get the money out of your pockets, literally anything. I support you in your journey and hope you get the justice you deserve."

Every Indian child knows about byjus now because he or she has seen it on indian cricket shirt.

So who's fault it truly is


Apparently kohli was involved in sponsoring of a gambling app that left many Indians broke..

Seems to me like sponsors are chosen purely for their money value.

But the right question is who's fault is it truly... Byjus or the Indian players who so openly commercialized byjus..

How can I put the entire blame on byjus when it's the Indian cricket players commercializing byjus

So was the whole Wolf Gupta character invention debacle. So, I have already signed the petition.

On the sponsorship cancellation front, I'm not sure what to make of the situation. If Byju's is the critical perpetrator that's misleading people and taking down dissent, then its sponsorship would get revoked. In the cricketing context, it happened with Vivo in the IPL. So, I'm wondering if the cancellation would be an end that would be achieved by the means or if the cancellation is the brake that's the immediate necessity.

Khan Academy also has CBSE (Central Indian education board) syllabus fully covered. We have to raise awareness about it. I have redirected every person who has asked me about Byju's to Khan Academy and they loved it."

What the fuck man? I don’t even live in India, I don’t have kids, and I still am keenly aware of how horrid the BYJUs product is because of family and friends. Why take so much money from them? Why put their logo so fucking big??

Do these BCCI donkeys have no shame? Will we put a cigarette company logo so prominently on the jersey? They won’t do one tiny bit of research?

And consider how many rich companies are in India today, fucks sake. And consider the multi nationals that want to advertise to Indians. You really think BYJUs is the only bidder?

No. I am sure they won this contract same way they do all their business: unethically, illegally. BCCI are complicit I’m sure.

At the very least, these shameful bastards should have the decency to reduce the BYJUs font size. Fucks sake I feel like I’m rooting for BYJUs nonsense team not my country because of these worthless kits. Pisses me off more than it should lol"

comment,How do you feel about BYJUs Logo on the Indian Cricket team's T-shirt? They filed a $2.75M defamation case over me.,3993,"Agree 100% with you. And I've been following WHJ scam from the beginning. My gf gave demo classes for them, so i know first hand how they're cheating gullible parents. And more power to you Mr Poonia for doing the great work.
But, actors/celebrities will endorse anything as long as they get paid. Many endorse alcohol, cigg(outside india), pan masala and what not. It sure is wrong on a moral level. But we as audience should develop common sense to differentiate between products based on their merits rather than who endorses. I know it sounds like wishful thinking but we as a consumer should be more vigilant when paying for products, especially if it has to do with education. Don't get me wrong, I'm in no way justifying their actions.

More importantly, what i feel is a bigger reason for the success of WHJ than the celebrities endorsing it is the culture that has come in our middle class where coding is seen as entry to high paying jobs. Few years back, it was the fad of IITs made famous by 1cr+package news headlines. Now it's ""coding = high package"". I feel this mentality needs to change because if it doesn't, today it's WHJ, tomorrow it'll be someone else. And there will never be a dearth of celebrities ready at a drop of hat to endorse such things as long as they make good bucks. Your thoughts?"
comment,How do you feel about BYJUs Logo on the Indian Cricket team's T-shirt? They filed a $2.75M defamation case over me.,3993,"So if I understand it correctly, all allegations considered, the case that was passed to trial against  u/pooniahigh was based seemingly on an unsubstantiated claim of ""hacking"", and also a strawman argument that the online teachers were being personally attacked.

Firstly as an outsider,  I don't accept the hacking allegation against them.  Surely the data was lawfully accessed as part of their role at CISCO and seems to highlight clear problems with internal whistleblowing procedure and deficiencies regarding the law surrounding that.  Issues that led to them leaving the role.

Secondly, unless there is more substance behind Whitehat.jnr's claim of a personal attack,  it seems to me as though they are using this claim to discredit any evidence and make it appear malicious.

I believe u/pooniahigh is acting for the greater good here to expose practices that in other legal spheres might warrant further scrutiny.  I think therefore signing the petition is justified.

Like I said I'm just an outsider and certainly no legal expert, but from a common sense point of view I believe in freedom of speech for the greater good so I'm behind this petition as it stands currently."

They filed a $2.75M defamation case over me.,3993,"Companies don't seem to care about how they're getting their money either. Both Byju's and WHJ are meant to, or at least claim that they are meant to, improve the education system. Their moves to sabotage is disgraceful, and even though the accusations aren't confirmed in court, it does seem to hold water given the ad removal order by the ASCI and the costs. I saw Glassdoor reviews to find out how things were there and the 'con' section in the reviews had positive comments. So, it is terrible.

Cancellation might happen, but the funding that you've mentioned can give Byju's a chance to somehow manage to keep the sponsorship intact. My feeling is that their revenue model is more of a problem than their overall objective of providing digital education. Of course, the WHJ acquisition and the subsequent violations does make the situation both infuriating and tragic. Should see what happens in court though, In this context, BCCI/ICC's decisions will be based on proceedings there."

by paying them top dollar from broadcast deals and sponsorships? The women's game is pretty much held together by excess sponsorship money from the men's game. Same goes for grassroots cricket.

comment,"Faulty GPS, no bio-bubble for ground staff, random hotel bookings: IPL SOP execution spot on in 2020, way off the mark in 2021",279,"Paraphrasing stuff because (1) you can't copy stuff from that shitty site (2) the English is confusing at places  

- BCCI hired a UK-based technology company Restrata to build a central bio-secure bubble in 2020. This year the board only provided hospital and testing facilities. No reason was given for this.  
- The franchises created their own bubbles for players and family members.  
- Ground staff were not part of any bubble at any point during the tournament.  
- Some franchises didn't ensure rigorous implementation of the bubble, such as returning to their old hotel booking after 12 days without ensuring quarantine in between (or holding the reservation) or moving into hotels before staff had completed their 14-day quarantine.  
- The contact tracing tracker didn't have sensors in the hotel or surroundings this time, but relied on a mobile app running 24X7 in the foreground to put out any reliable data. Sometimes, these fobs therefore sent data that was 48 hours old, when the entire team had already relocated to another city.    

Edit: Also apparently In UAE, they travelled by bus, avoiding airport terminals where most infections apparently come from. BCCI had an option of hosting in one or two cities, but they didn't take it because reasons, so players have to fly. 

------  

The BCCI probably thought their arrangements in 2020 was overdone or too expensive and that nothing could possibly happen because it didn't happen last time or some such complacent nonsense. I would expect this from certain others in India, but not the BCCI who has the resources to not need to compromise on anything.. 

Edit 2: Apropos Edit: Could've held it in Wankede, DY Patil, and Brabourne and it would've been chill. 🤷🏽‍♂️"

It was a shit show, but we can say BCCI current ups are complacent cheap asses, cost-cutting on wrong places, just for Indian team they have done so much shit. First accepting a fishy sponsorship from BYJUS then giving the jersey rights to a sports betting company they make shit housery jersey, they could've continued with a reputable brand but they preferred them cost cutting from world's richest board and also the biggest in the world and this is how they make stuff happen.

5 losses in the league phase isn't dominant by any angle. And they were playing their first XI throughout unlike MI in 2020 who rested players by the end."

comment,Most dominant IPL teams of all time?,534,He bowled badly in the finals no doubt. RCB choked even worse(even though I kinda expected it when ABD got out). But Watto bowled well in Q1 I think. He retired but was still played in middle order as an all-rounder(especially in 2017). CSK made him an opener and gave him full freedom to go all guns blazing from ball 1 and he didn't have to bowl.
comment,Most dominant IPL teams of all time?,534,No one expected SRH to win 3 straight playoff matches. They were an underdog.
comment,Most dominant IPL teams of all time?,534,"Well kkr lost while defending 260 so if that can be called dominant so can csk be and if you think rcb who finished number 1(2011) is dominant then you need to revisit the edition gayle was a goddamn storm who smashed every opponent on the other hand csk was a cohesive unit which took its opponents down and there's a reason why mi 2020 is at number 1 it is because they won with main players in bench

If we are nitpicking each team's shortcomings then mi 2020 lost their first match to a csk which would go on to finish second last
 
Mi 2020 - 5 matches lost

Csk 2011 - 5 matches lost

Kkr 2024 - 5 matches lost

Csk 2018 - 5 matches lost

So if losing 5 matches isn't dominant then all these teams are not supposed to be in the list too

If losing away matches are bad then consider losing in home that has to even worser atleast csk 2011 made chepauk their Fort but a team not able to make its own homeground as its forte cannot be called superior."

comment,Most dominant IPL teams of all time?,534,They destroyed Csk 3 times.
comment,Most dominant IPL teams of all time?,534,">Why does MI struggle during mega auction years

The simple answer is, at the end of each cycle, they have developed a greater bond amongst the current lot and the players whom they have scouted almost make it to the Intl side. So inorder to buy them back if at all they don't get retained, the lose out on a lot of money and to build a totally new group takes time. Examples for the above statement : Ishan Kishan, Boult, Qdk etc."

comment,Most dominant IPL teams of all time?,534,What special stuff are you on mate. When did KKR lose 5 matches this season.
comment,Most dominant IPL teams of all time?,534,"Does the Australian team from 2000's know that they aren't the most dominant team since they failed to defend 434 against South Africa.

It kind of shows that, it took some generational level stuff for Punjab to win the game.

If Gayle could alone gazump the dominant CSK team in the table, how dominant were they? You can't claim to be dominant and not even top the league stage. DD form 2009 actually can be considered as a really dominant team.

CSK is no doubt one of the best teams in the league in terms of consistency. But we are talking about dominance which MI 2020 & KKR 2024 showed. I mean it literally looked like formality in the playoffs as well in the case of both of these teams.

I am not nitpicking, I am talking about the overall demeanor and the conversation around the teams. These 2 teams were outrightly seen as the champions once they went on their run. CSK in 2011, kept faltering in every away match.

Having a great home record doesn't mean you are the best in the league. It means you have created a really good squad which suits your home conditions. The same players lost 5/7 games away. Say it had been like 2020, then they would have finished somewhere close to bottom in that case.

Lastly, as other corrected you already. KKR lost just 3 games in 2024."
comment,Most dominant IPL teams of all time?,534,"Yeah, as funny as it was MI winning in odd years and losing in even years was no coincidence.

We never got to know the results of last two league games if kkr so there's a good chance they could've won or lost them too

Just to reiterate the point the 2011 playoffs were a mere formality for csk too they never looked in trouble except for parts of q1.

SRH can't play Bairstow, Warner AND kanos together and Bairstow isn't going anywhere, specifically when Saha is 36.

post,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,N/A
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,Why can’t the third umpire do it? I am genuinely curious. Is there something they monitor during the delivery?
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"This is huge, not just as a concept/moment itself, but the fact that India is finally acknowledging their power and position, and that they are going to (hopefully) use it for the greater good. India's opposition to innovation (namely DRS and D/N tests) has been bewildering, to say the least. They should have been leading the way on these innovations, instead of being late adopters.

Yes I know they were the first to use DRS, but their opposition to it until a few years ago was extremely conservative and they had some backward logic and methods of raising their concerns over the system.

Anyway, I look forward to whatever else it is they come up with. It may seem funky at first, but if it's for the good of cricket, I'm on board....unless it's a PIG3 revamp, then count me out."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"I still don’t understand why cricket can’t use something similar to the goal line tech they have in football...if a bowler oversteps, the umpire beeps or vibrates and call the no ball?

I know it’s be expensive to implement short term but once it’s in place, in the long run surely it would work out cheaper than paying an umpire to it at every game?"
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"RCB will still find a way to fuck it all up. They'll win all their matches in the group stage and reach the final, only to lose of the last ball because of the DRS loophole in cricket's laws."

comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,How about a beep like in tennis? Sensors on the wickets could do the monitoring. The beep might give the batsmen that split second to take advantage of the original noball.
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,Been calling for this for years. It's something that is only really an issue at the highest level because of the speeds they bowl at. If the on field umpire can concentrate on the ball it will also improve their decision making with LBWs and caught behinds as they will have a better view without having to change focus from the crease to the other end of the pitch in the split second from release to the ball being played. It's something the extra umpire can immediately review and transmit the result to the on field umpire well before the next ball is bowled.
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"With umpire reviews and now this check for no-balls, the field umpires can get a nice bed & blanket and just doze off..."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"No no no. Step backward. Am I the only one who feels this way? You are taking a human element out of the game. Also taking the drama out of the game. DRS was an excellent and much needed inclusion, this is taking it too far.

Umpires should be good enough the pick up no-balls. If not, get better ones or simply live with it. It's all part of the game. Soon you will have something like an ""LBW Cam"" which gives you real time hawkeye projections to decide LBWs. Not a fan of this decision at all."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,It wouldn’t be the IPL without needlessly cluttering 10 guys to do the job of 2. Just look at the coaching staff for each team and the number of sponsors.

comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,Going to be much harder to have some software that detects if an inconsistently shaped object like a shoe is over the line (and taking into account things like the foot hovering or sliding) than whether a standardised sphere is.

You need kinky umpires for that!"
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"How would that even work? 

Bowlers don't stay within the line after releasing the ball, so the thing will beep or vibrate every single time. The umpire would have to be vigilant as to whether the ball was released or not at the exact point when it beeps.

That would not achieve any purpose, but having a machine go beep after every single delivery might be distracting for the umpire who's responsiblity doesn't end after the ball is released."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"This is the BCCI we are talking about. I'm surprised they're even considering this, new tech is well outside the realms of possibility for them."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,Yes but they have like 10 other things to worry about. International cricket has shown that its too much of a burden for umpires to do everything.
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,It's already 5 hours lolz!
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,Helps in more reliable spotfixing if anything. You spotfix and bowl a no ball only for umpires like Dharmasena and others to miss them and you lose out on the fix. This is a win win for everyone.
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"Wouldn't the thing beep every single time because the bowler will always go over the line after delivering the ball? The issue isn't whether the bowler overstepped but whether he/she overstepped at the time of releasing the ball.

You expect the batsman to notice the exact time when the beep went off while facing the delivery to determine whether the ball was released at the beep. They don't get that much reaction time."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"That's what was holding back cricket all these centuries!

Not enough umpires! We need MOAR!

* First Umpire : Gives crappy lbws and doesn't catch the front-foot no balls.
* Second Umpire : Often caught napping at square leg.
* Third Umpire : Only useful with 10+ cameras, Hawkeye and a big screen. Other times just sleeps.
* Fourth Umpire : Just brings the balls when old one is cunted out of the stadium or some cunt has bitten it or rubbed sandpaper on it.
* Match Referee : Mostly to remind VK that one more BC he will get b& for next series.

These umpires are so so overworked !! We need one more!!"
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"Actually, its not that hard. We have a bunch of image data already from every match. The only challenge would be to label the data-set with binary classification (1 for No Ball), (0 for Yes Ball) or whatever and then train a neural network to classify the images. I think it will work because neural nets are good enough to drive cars now so I don't see why they can't be good enough to see whether something is a no ball or not. They will just need to place a camera facing the no ball line to feed in real time image data to check if there's a no ball or not."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,India (along with Sri Lanka) were the first team to ever use DRS so your premise is automatically invalid.
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,The third umpire doesn't have anything else to do at the moment they'd be checking the no balls though. Seems a bit odd to have an extra umpire to do it when operationally having the third umpire do it worked absolutely fine in the ODI trials.
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"I was thinking stumps. Maybe just have an audio speaker at the batsmans stumps. Tennis uses Hawkeye anyways, so the technology is in cameras. On a noball, the stump beeps and the batsman gets a chance to instinctively go for a swing."

comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"Because in soccer it's simple - if ball is over line, it's a goal.

In cricket, its not about the foot going over the line - it's about the foot being over the line at the time of release. The system would have to recognise that the ball has been released and calculate from there."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"That is like using a selege hammer to crack a nut.  Also the accuracy is not increased with more training data, I mean some of Google's project have gone in the complete wrong direction.

comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"See me other comment in this thread. Just because they used it first, doesnt mean they were at all innovative in the area. 

They actively stood in DRS' way for years."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"It depends on the size of your training data set. Neural Net accuracy grows  with the number of labelled images you give it. So you would need to give it  thousands of images (at least) with the label of the foot and the line and then with a meta label of if its a no ball or not. If that's possible, it's relatively easy to build a classifier for this. The hard part is data collection. I would assume you would need access screenshots of the time of release from every match in the last 5-10 years. It's not an easy task but it's certainly achievable. It's actually very similar to a car ""overstepping"" a line on the road which is not unlike a foot overstepping a line on the pitch."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,"its worse than that - its about it being \*placed\* over the line, its allowed to slip over the line during the delivery."
comment,IPL 2020 to have 'specialist' umpire to monitor no-balls,226,Yeah dude that's fine. Machine Learning is magical that way. If you want some proof you can read an article here.

It is much, much harder to detect where the back of the foot was at the initial point of impact. Particularly when the natural deterioration of the pitch is a key component of turf cricket and therefore any technology embedded in the pitch doesn't disrupt that natural deterioration."

One thing that might be happening is, I think cricketer birthdays dont have random distribution. More cricketers are born in some months and less in some. Seems stupid? There is a study that shows it happens in NBA (or NFL I don't remember).

I might be wrong but there seems to be some non trivial reason for this."

comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,442,Well imo this happens because we are checking each person's birthday with every other person. Also notice that we are seeing if atleast 2 people have same birthday.
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,442,"That is interesting. 
So, this data set is not the best candidate for validating the hypothesis in OP."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,442,"That made it clearer but not really since i think the concepts are such that only a more mathematically oriented guy than moi could intuitively grasp them.

Also shouldn't 367 people be required for this to be a certainty ? (All possible days + 1)"
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,442,"If we're being pedantic, it should be 367"
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,442,"For most people, its difficult to understand intuitively how independent probabilities combine, as it contains exponentiation. Hence its also an easy way to fool people."
comment,[OC] Applying the Birthday Problem to IPL Teams 2020,442,Probability = 1- probability of two persons not having a birthday on same day. To find that use normal probability formula which = ( 365 * 363 * 362.......)/(365)^22

Morgan (in terms of Batting) = Stoinis + Hetmyer combined."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,The fact he's not coming in at 4 is a travesty of justice to KKR.

comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,Hope KKR Will retain him as captain for next 3 seasons minimum .He deserves it .
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Both DC and KXIP had 9 CR and 16 CR left after auction (even RR had 15 CR left), they could have definitely tried to bid up the price, people on this sub meme player who are sold for high price but forget the context of how the team is already build and the players available. That is why I think if Starc plays next IPL KXIP should be willing to spend 20 CR on him, it's a risk because Starc can as usual pull out of IPL but it's a risk worth taking. If the player doesn't perform you can always send him in next auction and get him back cheaply."

comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,2015*
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,His 30+ runs would be 50s if he batted at number 4 . He is playing with 138+ strike rate this season .
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Also Gill. Both have 400+ runs this season , Morgan's strike is Better though."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"He totally does, but with mega auction in 2022 nothing can be said."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Nobody should ever buy Starc. KKR have suffered enough. They bid 10cr for him, never showed up. If you pay someone 10cr+, he is part of your core plan. You pick everyone else around them. 20cr is a risk worth taking?? You dont take risks with 25% of your budget. 


Also DC KXIP and RR have historically been the teams that dont spend their full purse. At the end of the day, it is all about profits. Since they dont have enough advertisement revenue like the bigger teams, they depend on making profit by lowering the amount they spend. By saving that 15cr every season, that is a profit for them. 


Also once again, NO ONE, ABSOLUTELY NO ONE SHOULD BUY STARC EVER.


Edit: KKR had the best strategy that year. They built their team around 4 overseas players. Lynn, Russell, Narine and Starc. Paid 10cr to each. 50% of the budget gone. But they got an opener, a hard hitting all-rounder, a world class spinner, and probably the best bowler at that time. Starc not showing up costed them."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,Nah he was there in 2016 as well
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Yes ,but in mega auction you can retain maximum 5 players from your previous team . So Morgan should be one of those five ."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"> Nobody should ever buy Starc. KKR have suffered enough. They bid 10cr for him, never showed up. 

He was injured, can't do much about that."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"KKR bought him in mega auction, I agree don't buy such players who are not available in every season in mega auction cause you are building a brand new team during mega auction (that is why I think Buttler didn't get deserving price in mega auction cause he usually leaves for England at the end of IPL), the poll of talent available is so much bigger in that auction but during normal auction most teams are just trying to solve a part of puzzle, none of NCN or Cottrell would have gone above 4 CR in mega auction but because their respective teams already had a lot of money in purse and they were few of the best options available hence they were sold for 9 odd CR, even DK if released by KKR would probably go above 7 CR next auction, is DK worth 8 CR if mega auction next year? NO but considering the amount of money already left in teams purse DK would get 8 CR.

DC are not the kind of team who don't spend their full purse if you look at their history, KXIP/RR used to do it (especially RR) before for sure but after 2018 Star Sports new contract even they started to spend money."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Yup. That season we had Williamson, Morgan and Boult on the bench. The approach followed by the management was truly a horses for courses one and obviously that reaped benefits as we went on to win that season. 

Also IIRC, Warner did later credit valuable inputs from Kane and Morgan in his success as a leader. I remember he used to stand on the boundary line and constantly discuss with both of them all the time. Pretty cool when you think of it later."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Yes, but they released him after 2018. Starc wasn't with KKR in 2019, nor was he in the auction."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"2015. My point is that he got injured in 2016 and 2018, and didn't even put himself up for auction in the last two seasons. So, it's not like he screwed up his team's plans despite being fit, something a player like Chris Woakes might have done had Nortje not come off."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,He was released in 2018 as 2019 was a WC year and they knew Starc would prefer to take rest.
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"A guy who has not played 4 out of the last 5 IPLs (2 due to injury, 2 due to personal preference) would not be highly desirable for the teams."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Well yeah, I dont see anything wrong with that. He probably told them well in advance that he was going to miss that IPL."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Not really. If anything, him missing out on a million dollar cheque proves that he is quite dedicated to the teams he is playing for. So, if he's playing for you,  you can be sure that he's gonna give his 100%. 

Besides, he is one of the best white ball bowlers in the world, and any team would be willing to break bank for him. Even Cummins only played 1 out of the last 5 IPL seasons, and yet teams went berserk for him, despite him not being in the same league as Starc."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Which proves the point that he cant be relied upon. My entire point was that OP said KXIP should splurge big for Starc. Even 20cr. My point was that Starc is unreliable, and you can't build a team with Starc spending 20% of your budget, and then hope he is not injured, it is not a WC year or he doesn't want rest for the Ashes series coming up next."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,"Nobody should spend 20 crores on anybody, but you said nobody should even buy Starc, which is harsh. That's all I was arguing."
comment,For Eoin Morgan IPL 2020 is going best till now .,207,He hasn't even been in the auction for two years. That's what I was talking about with the million dollar cheque comment.

comment,Strike Rate Progression of Indian and Overseas Batsmen in IPL since 2020,136,"People who want to know how Pollard has been this successful while doing the hardest job in T20, all you have to know is he has done it for over 500 matches.

That is what he does everywhere. Closes the innings no matter in which team he is playing, he does just that.

Practice is the only way. If other teams want to get the consistency of Pollard with his hitting ability, choose couple of designated hitters and let them loose around the league all year doing just that.

Call him in the national team only for important T20Is and world Cups."

T:- Take Risk, Get Pain

&#x200B;

Edit:- He does have 1 questionable innings per season tho. Already has 1 this season. But peak Rahul is his innings against RCB in Ahmedabad. Scored 91\*(57) after the entire batting collapsed. Found a bit of support of Brar as well."
comment,Strike Rate Progression of Indian and Overseas Batsmen in IPL since 2020,136,Playing conservative atleast gets them to 160+. And it's funny you make such deductions even after witnessing the direct correlation of Rahul getting out in 1st six overs and the team not managing 130 this season.
comment,Strike Rate Progression of Indian and Overseas Batsmen in IPL since 2020,136,"Yep. Just that he sometimes forgets to accelerate at the end, which may not look very good. Being 40(30), 52(40) is acceptable, but then being 60(50) is not. He has 1 such knock this season."
comment,Strike Rate Progression of Indian and Overseas Batsmen in IPL since 2020,136,"Yeah, that is the only issue with him. He couldn't accelerate. He was doing that quite well in 2018 and 2019."

comment,Leading wicket-takers in IPL since 2020,202,Shami took 58 wickets for for Punjab in 3 season. Punjab should have retained him. He went for 6 cr while they bought Odean Smith for almost same price. Overall since 2019 he has 63 wickets in 44 matches.
comment,Leading wicket-takers in IPL since 2020,202,I was disappointed when Chahal wasn’t picked for T20 WC but heartbroken when RCB didn’t retain him.
comment,Leading wicket-takers in IPL since 2020,202,Chahal maybe better as a pure bowler but Hasaranga can be a genuine allrounder. He's so young too so RCB can have in the team for many seasons.
comment,Leading wicket-takers in IPL since 2020,202,Hasaranga is better than chahal only in terms of his overall game. Chahal is definitely a better bowler rn and we can’t predict the future but I would’ve wanted both of them in our squad.
comment,Leading wicket-takers in IPL since 2020,202,"I think they were partly trying to address the long tail problem. They don't want to let go of Siraj, good Indian pacers are like gold. And every team needs an overseas pacer. That's the reason Chahal was sidelined a little in the national setup"

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"I am a bit emotional so my thoughts might not be coherent, but this is Pollard so I will comment on this post. 


I have watched Pollard ever since he smashed 54(18)  for TnT( I think Moises Henriques bore the brunt), and Mumbai decided to bid for him. It truly feels like an end of an era with him retiring, but at the same time it fills my heart with great joy that he did not end his career with MI on a bench or on a sour note. 

My cousin used to talk about 90s India and ""Abhi Sachin khel raha hai"" (T: Sachin is still batting), a phrase which encapsulated India's belief in Sachin. It was same for us with Pollard. Nothing was impossible for him. Team looking at subpar finish? In the finals? He'd make sure that we had a target to defend. Reeling at 4-7? He'd play the anchor to bring team home. Countless matches where he took us from 130 scores to 160s; he was true finisher in all sense of the word. 

And batting was just one aspect of him. The catches he took, the dives and the throws, he was a beast. (Although I still recall him dropping 3 catches in a row, in a final, against CSK!!) Not to mention the 120 kmph deliveries he used to bowl, which would more often than not fetch a wicket. He once defended 9 or 12 against KKR, a match that at one point felt like a lost cause. 

Mumbai was the team to beat when the finishing trio clicked.
Hardik and Krunal elevated Pollard's game, and Pollard played a significant part in molding Hardik and Krunal into better players as well. The camaraderie was heart warming to watch, and that is one of the things I miss the most.  

In many ways, Pollard was the perfect encapsulation of MI spirit and the never say die attitude they bring on the field. I have lost count of times I've said that there should be his statue outside Wankhede, he has played way too many impactful innings for us. He was not the perfect player, he did have his ups and downs, but thankfully there were more ups than downs. It hurt to watch him struggle last year, hope he enjoys the role of coach and stays with MI for a long time. 

PS-  People talk about Dhoni placing the fielder straight down and Pollard falling for it, but he was the type of guy to back himself to clear the fielder. He might have been caught a few times, but this fearless approach is the reason I loved him as a player. 

Farewell, Polly. I hope you know how loved you are in India."

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Really sad about this but saw it coming. 

But like the countless other fans here, Polly has given me and other MI fans so many great memories and the best thing is he always performed in crunch matches (in almost all knockout matches where MI won, he had a very significant contribution). 

His six hitting ability is just superb and his calm face while hitting all those shots in pressure situations was what made him even greater. 

I would regard him as the second best Mumbai Indians player, after Malinga. Yes, he was even above Rohit. 

I think in death overs, he is among the top 3 batsman ever in IPL if not the best. 

Thank you for everything Polly and welcome as an MI batting coach!"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,One of the OGs of MI who was there and played a big part in each of their 5 titles. Will miss you big man.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Players like Pollard made IPL more than IPL making players like Pollard. I'm starting to really feel old now in the last couple of years.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,He does a  Pique. He retires at MI nothing better than that. It would have been very difficult to watch him play against us
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"I never thought that the 87*(34) vs CSK would be the last time he would destroy them... Watching IPL since its inception and Pollard has given me so many good memories.

In the IPL Final in 2013, he scored 60*(32). 
I was supporting MI that day because it was Sachin's last IPL

I thought he was finished after his poor performance in IPL 2018, but boy did he make a comeback in 2019 and 2020. The innings which he played against KXIP in 2019 was so ruthless. 

Thank you for the memories, but I am shocked to see his quick decline. He won three POTMs in 2021 but in 2022 he was just a pale shadow of his past self."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,A bit insensitive but about time. MI were carrying him purely just out of respect. The last 2 editions were clearly indicative of that.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,A true fucking legend man ❤️ If we ever start building statutes for our legend like they do in football then he should be the first one for MI. No other player was as synonymous with everything Mumbai than the big man himself. Bowling out just the way he played like a true King ❤️
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Pollard
Gayle
Russel
Narine
Bravo

This generation of West Indian players has given numerous superstars to IPL. IPL would have lost something substantial the day these players retire."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,I still remember the CT game (I think Final) when he announced himself on the big stage. Thanks Polly.

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Honestly might be the player I associate the most with MI after Malinga. Sad to see him gone, will always remember his catches and sixes and ofc his on field antics and how they irked the opposition fans."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Slowly the golden WI T20 age is coming to an end....

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,He’s won so many seemingly unwinnable games for us. Won the first IPL final. Blasted all sorts of bowlers all over the park. Took at least 1 impossible catch per season
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Honestly, could have played a bit more bruh... MI should have preplanned things and retained Boult ahead of Pollard maybe"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Clearly asked by the owners to retire. But they were gracious to offer him the coaching role.
Wonder what place rohit will have when he retires since coaching is gone now."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Let's hope Nohit doesn't follow his lead and also announce his retirement from IPL. And I'm hoping for this because I hate MI and want to see them keep losing.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Will miss him a lot.. No matter how close we were to losing, I always thought there might be a chance whenever Pollard wasleft to bat. One of the best IPL players of all time and best of MI alongside Malinga.."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Thanks for scoring runs in IPL final 2019 against CSK. That was a great inning. With Malinga bowling helping MI to win.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"I’m noticing a lot of people retiring from IPL, what’s going on? People aging and just quitting? I saw somewhere on here pat cummins isn’t able to play as well"

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Off topic: it’s odd to me to read “not good enough to play in the IPL but will play in the other league”, which automatically makes the other league look bad and watered down farm league. I mean obviously IPL is the leader, but since UAE league is attached to IPL, wouldn’t they want to protect it"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Reminds me of how Kumble had retired from the ipl saying he doesn't see himself playing other than for RCB when hewas let go.

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"What a great shame. Such a magnificent all round player has finally bowed out. Mumbai Indians will be at a loss without Kieron - but another guy will, eventually, take his place. I shall miss watching him next year but fully understand his reasons for retiring."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"With Pollard retiring, I think that is the last international superstar in the IPL we had.

Hayden, Gilly, Watson, Gayle, Warne, McCullum, ABD, Malinga, among others were the true stars that were so loved by the Indian audience.

I don't recall any other genuine international superstar that we have playing in the IPL anymore"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"2 moments that just made me like Pollard 

1. That time at Wankhede when Starc was riling him up and when it was too much by Starc, he just threw his bat at him in utter fury. That was rare to see but nevertheless some moment

2. Again vs RCB, this time at Chinnaswamy. Pollard was having a ""friendly chat"" with Gayle in the over break during RCB innings, the umpires told Pollard to not talk with him. So he decided to just put cellotape on his mouth. Harsha bhogle was laughing his ass off in the comms and so were we.

There are many more that I could've liked if I was an MI fan (I'm an RCBian btw) but for sure he'll retire as an icon, a legend and ofc an entertainer atleast for me. Good luck in the future,  keiron."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,But on long term I believe its nice The team shown there loyalty towards the player and when the time came in the player showed his.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Well that's the risk of retaining players who are on the wrong side of age but can single handedly change the game on their good days.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,More like they had a conversation and decided on this. MI have a replacement for him last season and it was clear his time has come to an end. And i can't imagine mi releasing their oldest player who has won them so many games.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,">Now it makes me think that MI should’ve gone with boult or De kock in the last retaintion.

Don't think they would have accepted the 6cr retention slot."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,">the one against CSK


Which one. There must be like 10"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,The one where he singlehandedly snatched the game from KXIP's grasp in 2019...
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,My favorite inning of his is still the one against SRH in 2013. Just goated stuff
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"As an RCB fan, I luckily missed his innings in the Badree hat-trick match but I remember his innings against us in 2020 (or was it 21?) in which Kishan scored 99. Both Kishan and him were fantastic. I was speechless. Thankfully, we won in the super over. 

Would definitely miss Pollard."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Not a knock on what you said and what people are generally saying but calling everyone a GOAT isn’t mathematically feasible.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"NGL, but I have seen this in corporate part of RIL too. If you stick with them, they do take good care of you as well. I guess Mukesh Ambani knows how to find good people and how to treat them well.

Will miss Pollard on the field, but thank goodness he is still with MI."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Man I'm gonna miss CSK fans shitting their pants whenever pollard comes to the crease, all the MI greats are retiring slowly like malinga, Johnson and now pollard"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,His inning of 80-odd against you guys in 2019 was BEAST.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"for me as an mi fan pollard and malinga will always be what made mi mi , fearless batting and killer bowling,  pollards batting style was later taken up by pandya and for malinga bumrah took the spot"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Greatest finisher is ABDV. Pollard had those 1-2 unbelievable innings every season but didn’t really turn up as a finisher as often as AB did. Ab did it 8-9 games out of 14, every season for 10+ years straight"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"I can see Mitchell Starc coming back to IPL now that Pollard is gone.  

Perfect timing, he was dropped from Aus T20s too."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"From 2019-2022 he averages 30.2 striking at 151.7. Tremendous numbers, given how shit he was in 2022. 

2020 is absolutely staggering. He averaged 53.6 striking at 191.4

In 2019 he did really well, but Hardik Pandya was at his batting peak (sr 191.4 avg 44.7) and scored 402 runs batting at no. 6. Pollard played second fiddle that year.

2021 numbers were heavily boosted by that one knock against csk, which I honestly believe was so good people couldn’t really comprehend it. It should have got waaaaayyy more attention. Fucking ridiculous."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,No way ! Did you even watch IPL 2019 and 2020? He was at his best in those 2 seasons. Even 2021 was good when he won 3 POTMs. Only 2022 was super bad
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,How can you forget 2019 final?
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Absolute IPL legend. He was one of the only few OGs still playing. Malinga, ABD, Gayle and now Pollard too. Only player whon you can relate directly to the entertainment is Bravo now. Few years from now it will be nostalgia how they once ruled IPL."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,So many cricketers have embraced their clubs. I remember QdK saying winning ipl was his biggest moment of life too.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,I remember a game where he dropped 3 consecutive catches only to take a blinder 5 minutes later.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"About time for sure. He was decent (below expectations) in 2021, striking at 148.5 average 30.6. These numbers were boosted by that godly knock against csk, which I think is way more than enough to warrant having faith in him for another season.

He didn’t drag it on by any means. Good on him."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,10 vadapav and lots of money
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"No more bats at his face

&#x200B;

now, there will be bats at his ass"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Is this really that outrageous of a suggestion? Especially since he will continue to work with MI in two different avenues going forward. 

I'm genuinely curious"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,60 (32) is my favourite memory always
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"My favourite Pollard memory is when he let go of the ball on the boundary after fielding it, to dare Dhoni to take a single. And Dhoni took the single comfortably. One of many moments when Kieron Pollard tried to act smart, but ended up being a loser."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Yeah they would've, Boult got sold for less than that and QdK got sold for only a little more than that and he comes from South Africa."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Exactly my feeling right now. From first learning about these players as a newbie in cricket fanaticism to seeing the news of their retirements...quite a bit of time has passed, hasn't it? Odd feeling to have when you're only 20."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Second greatest. Ab will always be no.1
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,10 ? Make that 15 or something
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"There are like 20~ innings by opponent batters, where they snatched the victory from PBKS single handedly"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,that was 20 ....thats was the best match of the season tbh....chasing mammoth 200+ and gearing up by both batters in last 5 overs
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Dude literally played match winning knocks in 2013, 2019 ipl finals and he has come through for MI when needed more often than not lol, that's more than enough for him to be a GOAT"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Hardik and Krunal always credited him as the one who helped them the most. So, I have high expectations from Pollard in coaching department."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,He'll be a mentor for a few years then a coach. Big money cricket knows how to hold onto talent. He'll be a big part of the advertising push for mi for a long time
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"We all will be slowly moving out of that MI vs CSK rivalry I guess.. In some years, Jaddu, Thala and Rohit will also retire and the rivalry won't be the same anymore."

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,87(34)
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"2020 was probably the best T20 team of all time across all countries and leagues.

Rohit, QDK, Ishan, SKY, Hardik, Pollard....Boult and Bumrah!"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Malinga is was and will always remain greatest t20 player of all time in my book but pollard is close 2nd. Cant imagine how our team would have been without those 2

Edit: by pollard being close 2nd i mean for MI"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"That match against RCB where Samuel Badree took a hatrick and MI was 7-4 only for Pollard to win it for them 

Quite a few times against PBKS (KXIP) and a few innings against KKR too cross my mind"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Imo, as a professional not a cricketer. For at least the out going generation being a world cup winner is the greatest thing they can be. Coz they grew up dreaming of it. In their childhood franchises werent a thing. Winning the Ashes may have similar emotions for an Eng/Aus player. If QdK had won a WC, he would put winning the ipl as second. This may change for the 20 year olds coming through now.  But international cricket right now, probably for the last time ever, is still the pinnacle of the sport."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"That would be because he hasn't achieved anything with South Africa tbh. Even by the time he started playing test cricket for them, they weren't the standout world number 1 anymore. And of course they are trophyless in international white ball cricket"
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,I want to add the 87(34)* to it. What an inning!
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Was that our first IPL win? I remember him always showing up against CSK in the finals but our first one where he was the only player that batted well will always be his best ever innings in my eyes
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,">Boult got sold for less than that

RR bought him for 8cr.

The point is they would have expected to get more than 6cr at the auction since they are quality proven international players."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Statistically and ideally, David has to be the greatest ever IPL player (won a trophy as a skipper and most overseas runs, that too at an amazing average). But ABD's innovation was something else too.

Would be silly of anyone to number their ranks as legends."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,2013 final for me. We wouldn't have reached 120 without him
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Totally agree but does that make him the greatest though? By that token, you’ll have a lot of GOATs. Agree with the fact that he’s been a gun player in the past, just don’t agree with the GOAT moniker."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Bumrah, SKY have already established themselves as the current MI great players

Kishan can maybe become that but other than these I see nothing"

He meant 83(31)"

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Greatest t20 player of all time chris Gayle. Everyone else comes second.
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Still remember the 2019 innings by pollard against y'all while chasing 198
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Well Tim David was doing the Pollard finisher role last season already. Finishing games and putting bowling attacks to the sword in the last 5 overs, so it's been happening already."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,That was the 2013 final
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"They definitely would have, Boult has never gotten sold for more than 6 CR in any auction, and before last year's auction even QdK never got sold for more than 6 CR, and as a South African he would have more desperation to secure high retention money than take chance under the hammer."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Most overseas runs yes, but Ab has second most overseas runs at almost the same average (within a couple of runs average wise) plus a much better strike rate. Add this to the fact that Warner mainly bats in the power play as on opener whereas AB almost never does. Warner, Ab and Gayle are in a league of their own in the IPL but within that I’d put AB above the other 2 due to the above reasons. Plus I’ve never seen anyone else take apart Bumrah, Boult, Rabada, Malinga, Steyn and Jofra so consistently."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,nvm probably confused it with a 2018 game or smth. i remember him power hitting in mohali in a low scoring game (with rohit injured and him being captain)
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"He has contributed the same as gayle and ABD for his team if you think Gayle and ABD are GOATs of IPL, then he should also be considered as one."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"True for me he is 2nd but Malinga comes as first for now

Imagine MI only lost Thrice when score was 165+ until 2015 when Malinga was in the team. His 4 overs were too op"

Boult got 8cr, MI went ill 7.75cr."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"Skill-wise, ABD is probably the best batsman EVER to have graced the game. But since the other IPL greats have performed different roles, it is just not right to compare them numerically after that. Guys like Gayle and Davey would seldom get themselves to the 15th-16th over mark, because they are openers. Others didn't captain their sides. All in all, stats won't tell the complete story ever. It's just my opinion though. What you said is 100% agreeable."
comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,The last ball of malingas career in IPL IS goated especially after he got shat on the entire season for being past his prime that was a perfect fuck you all I'm ending on an absolute high

Had he retired in 2015 itself his record would be very difficult to beat only rashid khan would have any chance"

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,"We had the best team, couldn't  have kept everyone, Not a blunder but a great opportunity for Hardik to captain a team and beneficial for Indian team in future"

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,Fair enough. but man that 2016 season just lives in my head rent free might never see something like that again.

comment,Kieron Pollard has announced his retirement from the IPL.,1856,You're actually making assumptions by saying you don't see anyone else ending their careers as MI greats. You could've said there's exciting talent but you said you don't see anyone else.

comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,Its a throw of dice between all of them...the biggest problem for kkr has been ineffective indian pacers...and injuries have hampered the foreign players available... hopefully cummins solves the death overs problem for us..
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,Perhaps you haven't been watching the CPL. 140 runs at 154.4 SR and 5 wickets at 4.88 ER in four matches.
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,"Had a very promising start in Ranji Trophy, hopefully he can keep that going. Has good height and pace."
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,"Wow. So out of his 8 finals, Dhoni lost every final against MI. Won 3."
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,Csk did win their first IPL in 2010 against MI!
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,"That's the problem. It's really exciting for the first couple of weeks, but becomes too much after that. I'd rather have a match every alternate day to build up the anticipation."
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,"I don't think so, he's being rested for the IPL and for TKR to try out new players. KKR and TKR are owned by the same people, so they can pull strings and have Narine rested to not risk injury.

And I'm not certain, I'm just saying this could be the squad. If not for Rinku, we could have Tripathi and Gill open and have Narine play at 7, but my gut says Narine will be open."
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,"2010.

2011 was RCB humiliation"
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,"That'd definitely be better for fatigue, but there's no way to really play 70 games, each with a day in between."
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,"Because 2 months for one tournament is a pretty big window as it is, if they essentially double the time, that's  4 months of IPL, which is frankly too much, not just because it prevents international cricket, but because it's just too much IPL."
comment,IPL 2020 Schedule,106,"It's the same amount of IPL, just spread around a little more. For context, 3-4 months is about par for a full international tour with 5 Tests, ODI, and T20 series."
post,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,N/A
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,Seems like IPL has big return on investment. The Mickey mouse is defenitely taking it for another 5 years if Ambani or Bezoz choose not throw all their pocket money on it.
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,It would be an uphill task to keep same per match viewership after 2 more teams. I just hope they don't drag the tournament too long or divide it into 2 groups and Sony's pre-game shows come back. May be even Siddhu can come back with the way things are going in his political career.
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,I think the 5 months gap might have actually helped a bit for viewers to overcome cricket fatigue for the second half and would've increased some viewers.
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,380 million is exactly what? Aggregate viewers or average per match?
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,I think Ambani and Bezos should combine to take down Mickey mouse. Or Ambani can even go with his friend mark
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,"That is expected. IPL is still on its growing phase. It would take another 10 years and a few more teams for it to peak. Also, Hotstar is about to lose HBO content when HBO Max launches in India. Disney is not going to let go off IPL in the near future."
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,Ambani's entertainment channels in India are joint-owned by CBS America. So there's plenty of money backing them too. And Sony and Zee have merged together now so they should have lots of money too.
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,What sports channel does Ambani own/co-own? Or will they be bidding only for digital rights (Voot/JioTV) like Amazon?
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,"In the long run, those 2 teams especially the one fron Lucknow would increase viewership imo."
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,Overall viewership may increase even though per game viewership may slightly decrease. I don't think broadcasters wont mind extra matches as it will give more ad money
comment,IPL 2021 continues to register significant growth in viewership. 380 million TV viewers (till match 35) which 12 million more than IPL 2020,191,"Overall viewership will increase. New markets will have more hardcore fanbases. 

People won't be watching every game. They're also going for simultaneous matches knowing it's better to have more games with good viewership vs few games with excellent viewership."

Ofcourse that's from a viewing point rather than revenue point but 14 games feels too long tbh"

Why should I spend even a minute thinking about people who don't benefit me in any way..this isn't an agenda stuff. Am educating the masses just like bhagat singh or jyotiba phule did. It's called social work. Out country doesn't need any more Rohit or Shami. At best this is just manual labour swinging the bat, throwing that ball. There is nothing intellectual about what they do.

comment,Why DC is at top of the table in IPL 2020,155,"Yeah looking at the teamsheets before the tourney began, these were my picks for the final besides RCB and KXIP in the playoffs. I was excited to watch DC and KXIP this season and both teams have for the most part lived up to their billing (besides KXIP losing those 3 close games...) and I still hope one of them goes on to win it all this season. I felt KXIP is just a death bowler short of being on par with DC, but so far surprisingly Shami has outdone the so-called specialist Jordan. If only Shami just focusses on his yorkers which he can bowl at will, instead of trying to randomly bounce people as he does in Tests and thereby give away runs off edges repeatedly, watchout for KXIP in the final sprint for the last spot."
comment,Why DC is at top of the table in IPL 2020,155,"I want DC vs MI final as well, I want MI to win but DC is the only team against whom the burden of loss would be less. This DC is amazing tbh it has KXIP 2014 vibes."

comment,Why DC is at top of the table in IPL 2020,155,"DC has to hold on to that top spot or atleast finish in the Top 2, to give them that cushion to settle their nerves in the playoffs. I feel they need a game against MI first-up in the playoffs before inevitably facing them in the final."

And yes we both are on the same page w.r.t DC and their youth setup. Although I'm from Hyderabad and was originally a Deccan Chargers fan, now besides DC I also like KXIP, hopefully they finish strong and get that 4th playoff spot."

comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,Stupid decision by KXIP. He was bowling well and was pretty good captain. I don't know how good is KL with captaincy.
comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,"Lol, burn this team to the ground and start a new one in its place. Never have I ever seen a more inept team management ever. Why would you not release someone like Miller, who has been consistently shit for over 3 years? Instead you release you best performing bowlers of last year? 

Here's a list of players who should've been released before Ashwin. Miller, Mandeep, Tye, Viljoen, among some other deadweights. But no, lest release Ashwin. Fuck this stupid shit of team. I hope you never win KXIP, with the way you treat your players and your fans."
comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,"Why would Ashwin go to delhi than go to Chennai? His home ground? A venue that was spinners paradise last year? A team who will need a proper captain when Dhoni retires in a year probably

Delhi already has iyer, and they already have such a good lost of spinners. Why add Ashwin? 

And lol at Rahul being the captain. We even lost Mike hesson, idk why I even support kxip anymore"
comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,Really poor from kx1p... Changing the core of the team often results in a demoralising way to a team... Considering there wasn't any core to the team it even more hurts their chance..
comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,"Honestly who's the one gaining here is really tough to decide. Delhi aren't doing themselves much of a favour with roping in an Indian spinner when they've got an abundance of them. Punjab were a team in transition, and while their season rankings weren't the best, but Ashwin was doing a good job leading them and instilling a solid team culture. Besides I'm not really sure how good is Rahul as a captaincy candidate. Interesting to see."

comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,"Given they trying to rebuild, KXIP should also get rid of Varun Chakravarthy and Prabsimran Singh. 

1) KL
2) Gayle or Miller at 5. (Overseas)
3) Agrawal (if Miller then opener)
4) Nair 
5) Pooran ( Overseas)
6) Batting ALL Rounder buy
7) Axar (they could get him from DC)
8) Curran/Morris/ Bowling AR/ Bowler (overseas)
9) Shami
10 and 11) 2 out of Mujeeb/Tye/M Ashwin/Rajpoot depending upon foreign quota. 

So, giving up Ashwin, Prabsimran and Varun gives them over 20 cr. Easy to buy one backup spinner and one all rounder with that kinda money. If Sam Curran won’t be available then with 27 cr left in tank to buy 2 ALL rounders and backup spinner, backup keeper and a backup pacer."
comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,"Rahul must be the most charismatic man in cricket world rn. Nothing else explains dozens of chances after he'd squandered all of them and this bs.

Ashwin was actually a good captain."
comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,"As a die hard DD/DC fan through thick and thin (mostly thin) over the years, I don't like this. DC were finally gelling as a team with everyone getting comfortable in their respective roles and a young captain who was a guaranteed selection for all matches in his own right as a batsman.

Now the management will be tempted to give the captaincy to Ashwin who will have twenty different twisted theories about every part of the match. Also, an off spinner is not a guaranteed selection in IPL for every match but since he'll be the captain, he'll inevtibly take up a spot in the team for the matches where he's not needed.

And then there's the budget. Who are DC giving up for Ashwin? I dread it's going to be a key member of the last year's team to make up for Ashwin's salary cap space.

An all-around bad move by the DC management. There maybe a potential upside in certain scenarios but there seem to be far too many potential downsides."

This looks like a very formidable lineup, but is missing the key lower order batsmen. If Maxwell is playing IPL again, he could slot right in (even after shit 2018 season). I would honestly love if we can manage to get Eoin Morgan somehow - imo is the perfect player for a young team like DC."

Tye is still a decent T20 bowler but probably not worth the price we have him at, Hardus admittedly looked out of his depth in the IPL.

But Mandeep to apna banda hai yaar and he hasn't really done anything wrong. He's a good fielder and he's an excellent Indian middle order batsman. There is no logical reason to release him before unloading guys like Karun Nair."

comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,Delhi are actively working on a  strategy to win the ipl by 2021-2022 They will  hold a monopoly over all the spinners not playing for CSK(unless dhoni retires then they too will be targeted)  and when the lone spinners of the other teams are injured or under performing they will make a trade to receive 2 top t20 superstars for each spinner they give away.
comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,I think management felt he was a bit of a shit magnet with his chopping and changing and mankading.

I remember when he used to open for us, such a talented lad. But he's being wasted at no 5 spot. He doesn't have the muscle power to clear boundary at will and Mohali is a big ground. KXIP management, stupid as it is, saw Mandeep clear ropes at will in small Chinnaswamy ground, and brought him as a finisher. But he's a much more talented batsman, more suited at no 3 spot, but we already have Karun and Mayank for that spot. So there's no place for him, imo."

comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,They've done a terrible job of marketing the team in Punjab. Chandigarh/Mohali is not not going to attract a big audience. There is little sports interest there and its literally in the corner of the state. The PCA should have originally built the new stadium in the heart of the state in Ludhiana/Jalandhar ibstead of Mohali. This would have made it much more accessible to Punjabis as opposed to now where the majority of fans are just people with Kal ho na ho hangovers.
comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,"As in United have had success in the past, Punjab doesn't have much to cling to. It's more of an Everton, but without the rivalry and occasional entertainment."
comment,"R Ashwin is set to join Delhi Capitals for IPL 2020, with KL Rahul the favourite to be appointed captain of Kings XI Punjab",73,"Actually the Premier League, as we know it, is 27 years old. 13 of which ended with Man U winning, 6 of which they were 2nd, and another 3 where they were 3rd. That's 22 of 27 seasons where they were in the top 3. Along with Chelsea and Liverpool, they're the only English team to win UCL since the formation of the Premier League.

If you want to look at the last decade, the only teams to win it multiple times are Man U, Man City, and Chelsea. Sure they've been shit since Fergie retired (which has just been the last 5 or 6 years) but they were the most unbeatable ever for quite some time.


Also, just for the record, I am a Chelsea fan, I hate Man U, and I find it really funny to see how bad they've become. However, you just have to give credit where credit is due."

KXIP have no player loyalty, everytime a player starts to get famous, they sack him. Happened with Maxi. The other way to be a popular team is by winning, but KXIP can't be bothered by it.

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"This is a part of sports unfortunately, and this will completely disappear when MI starts winning matches. If they win the tournament, the same critics will bend over for Pandya."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I think he was prepared for this hate.

The people at fault: owners and to a extent , pandya.

There was no need for buying hardik pandya in a under handed way. 

People are hating pandya for accepting this underhanded deal by denying to play at gt at his peak if they don't sell.

If this trend continues, you ll be seeing Kohli in MI as well.(Aka all star players go to rich) . There's a strong chance Kohli to decline the deal even though he has no trophies with team."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Don't think it has been amplified unnecessarily . Played for a franchise where he won them their maiden title in their inception season , took them to runners up in next edition but suddenly saw a bigger opportunity in his previous club , signed them for a bigger money pool also had a captaincy clause in his contract which eventually led to the sacking of the most successful IPL captain of all time who made MI what they are today . In all this drama angry fans have all the right to show their dissatisfaction towards the ""disloyal"" attitude of hardik

People complain we are individually obsessed , IPL is money only and fans have no connections with their teams but when GT fans did found the transfer ugly and booed hardik pandya with rohit posters it raging an unnecessary discussion towards the so called hate . idk why we are too soft as cricket fans , a few days ago we wanted luis figo level treatment for him but now loosing our shit on such small gestures which is not even 10% of what Figo faced"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Look yes the hate is getting out of hand I have seen people throwing chappals on screen when hardik shows up but the comparison of corporate jobs in invalid here. You know what would have happened if Ronaldo left Madrid and joined Barca cause they gave more salary and proceeds to replace Messi as the captain. I know what happened here was not that extreme, but Rohit Sharma literally was the best captain the franchise has ever seen, and also the dirty politics behind it and MI's management's lack of speaking out just pours oil to the fire. 


So yes the hate is a bit too much, but I can never get over the fact that a player who blamed MI for hiring star players ( he himself grew in MI ) proceeds to replace the captain while leaving captaincy in a team which was very successful."

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"It’s easy to kick a man when he’s down. The man captained GT, got them a trophy in their first year, and took them to a final in the second year, and almost won it the second time too. So there’s nothing wrong in asking for the captaincy. 

The Mumbai management has decided to handover the captaincy to him, they could’ve considered Bumrah, but they handed it over to Pandya who’s had a decent record in the two years he’s captained. 

The man is coming out smiling, captaining his team, it’s the fans who’re interpreting and starting to spread hate. He asked Rohit Sharma to stand near the boundary, so what’s wrong in it ? And in yesterday’s game Rohit asked Hardik to stand near the boundary, they all work for the betterment of the team, these fucking Instagram pages instigate people, and they also behave senselessly like the shit they see in reels."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"When he moved from MI to GT they marketed stories around him as the son of Gujarat, perfect o lead GT. They made out stories about how he was unwanted in MI and GT was home for him. 

When GT won that year, this branding was magnified 1000 fold. Hardik himself started spewing nonsense about MI and was very anti MI. In local press, local advertisements all you saw was Hardik in Gujarat not even Gill. 

During this time, the man uses every opportunity to put down MI. I get it, they didn’t want you at one point now you’re leading a good team, good for you. But this toxic flaming GT fandom is now coming to bite him. 

Now, two years later, after all of this son of Gujarat hype, ambanis dangle a good carrot, the man not only moves to MI but suddenly calls it home. 

Ambanis take it one step further, instill him vs a much loved captain. What was worse, the first match at his prior home ground - where he suddenly says its good to be back home in MI? 

Boss? What did they think is gonna happen? 

Unless as folks here have said MI starts really winning matches, or they amplify good PR for Hardik, this is going to continue. 

How to make him a Mumbai boy right now? You can’t. The story just isn’t there."

Most shameful thing is some people on the MI sub wanting MI to lose (so-called “Rohit fans”). I’m sure even Rohit wants to win and has no qualms about Hardik being captain. No one denies Hardik shat the bed yesterday while batting but no, the guy’s just not getting a break. The good thing is that he keeps smiling. If you can smile when things are at their worst, nothing will stop you when times are good :)"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"As a fan of both CSK and MI, 

I see Ppl are crying as he got got better in life financially considering what he was before. Even veteran cricketers are bashing him out. He no longer gets any soft corner from anyone as they are judging him.

For me this doesn't matter. Transfer are subject to franchises. If GT had no problem in losing him, why are ppl crying? If MI had no problem in changing 2nd most sucessful Captain ever, I dont have any problem over there.

We will see many more all cash transfers in coming days. 

Look at politicians near u. How many jump parties? Boo them. They work for you. Not these cricketers. 

Ppl just cant tolerate him. I agree there are some problems with Hardik's behaviour but mark my words. 
He has the potential. If there is anyone who can hit without even thinking, its him. 

I strongly feel this is just another small phase of his life just to realize who are among his side and who are not. 

He will rock. He will justify his transfer to MI. The innings are not too far away. I am sure he will do what he used to do in MI initially. 

Shivam Dube too is a amazing talent. He also can stand and deliver fearlessly. I hope he stays relevant for very long period of time."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,Ya . From the start of the match star hindi commentator was questioning pandyas captaincy specially irfan . second inning   start they again start questioning bowling changes . It is good questions but you are commentator why are you analysing same thing throughout the game . If every bowler get trashed then they should first question pitch but every problem was because of pandya. I think everyone is making pandya villeins like pakistan to get more number. It give good story and engage people with ipl.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,Yes the hate is unnecessary. I don’t understand why people are affected from results of a domestic league.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"People can have opinions and criticism though. And all this is doing is bringing more attention towards ipl which is a greater good. At this point cricketers have to be used to this bs. Hardik pandya is generally hated until he wins matches for India. So this is completely normal for him. Even now, Virat and dhoni ""fans"" who are just Rohit haters start to talk bad about Rohit and support hardik. Virat fans call this karma. Rohit fans obviously hate that hardik is captain and are abusive towards hardik. Mi fans are of the general belief that sky or bumrah should have been the one's rewarded with captaincy. Sky's shit stories with 💔 and stuff don't help.

So this is all an ecosystem now. There's support towards him from certain fan based and due to this support there's a surplus of hate. I don't normalise this behaviour or rather acknowledge it as acceptable behaviour. But the plain hard truth is, until this is a trending topic, there will be creators wanting their 2 cents out of this. Nobody can change this. The less we talk about it, the faster it stops. Nobody talks about stale topics. Everybody needs a fresh topic to comment on. By such posts you only add fuel to the fire."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I mean Indian Cricket fans are like this, ain't even surprising, more emphasis on individual glory in a team sports has been the case for a very long time, most of you ipl franchise fans anyways support teams because of some individual.

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"No you're not the only one. It's becoming very clear by the day, how the entire establishment (broadcasters, commentators etc) are hell bent on putting pressure on Hardik because he didpdged their favourite son from captaincy."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"There's a lot of hate for saying shit about MI after MI literally raised him to be the player he is.

There's hate because of mindless captaincy and his disappointing performance with the bat when the whole team contributed. 

The hate is for trying to be the hero and fucking up key moments of the match.

The hate is for trying to bowl overs when pressure is created/in safe patches of the match. 

It's not unnecessary but yes it is amplified beyond these reasons"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,He is getting hate for a while even before this He was getting some hate I guess this was the final nail in the coffin.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Ofcourse it's unnecessary. If at all one should be upset, it should be at MI managment, the man just accepted a life-changing contract which 99% of players would have said yes to.

All these people in the sub saying he is getting hate for not performing with the bat. Rohit hasn't performed with the bat many seasons, and has had worse numbers than 24 for 20 many times. Never has he got this sort of hate. He started getting hate before he captained a single game.

Hating him is still one thing, these guys aren't even letting his wife go. Calling her second hand, a whore, saying Rohit will have her, and all sorts of vile comments on her instagram. Are these comments because of his poor captaincy?"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"My biggest issue with this whole situation is the team selection, toss decisions and on-field captaincy decisions have not been as good as it was compared to his 2 years as GT captain

Let me tell you a playing 11 and impact subs and tell me your thoughts if it is a better team for MI to try 

1. Rohit
2. Ishan
3. Naman

5. Hardik 
6. Wadhera 
7. Romario 
8. Nabi
9. Coetzee 
10. Bumrah 
11. Madhwal

Solid Batting is there till 8

5 pacer option and 3 spinners options (though all three are offspinners)

Impact subs

2. Tim David (can come in if a finisher is needed)
3. Thusara ( can come in if extra pacer is needed)
4. Chawla ( can come in if wrist spinner is needed)
5. Mulani ( can come in if finger spinner is needed)"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Bhai jab Virat jaise player ko nhi chora to fir ye bichara Pandya kya hai. Us Indians don't know how to appreciate good things, all we know is how to criticize someone."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"It’s in the nature of people. If one chooses money over loyalty then everyone will abuse . If the same scenario happens with the people everyone will definitely choose money over loyalty. You can disagree with me saying Virat, Dhoni and Rohit are loyal to their franchises. They are GOATS and have enough money to live their life happily and still have money left. So cricket is their passion not a job. However the scenario is opposite in case of a new player from domestic levels. Just ask yourself the same Question-money or loyalty? I agree that Pandya having money has become money minded but remember he still is a part of Indian team. Hate is justified but his actions are making it much worse."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Basically, GT and Rohit Fans shitting on Hardik Pandya. I use to hate that guy for being a hype guy than anything else, but he definitely has matured as a Player and his game has improved alot. 

His captaincy, on his debut he won IPL. Immediately after he got back into Finals. That doesn't happen just like that."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"The thing is,   
Indian Cricket watching crowd is illiterate mostly (like 90%), Booing Hardik a couple of times in Ahmedabad was okayish as he was GT's captain, but Hyderabad too ? and why were they chanting Rohit, It was really bad.   
Hardik at the end of the day plays for INDIA, if his mental health deteriorates coz of this, India will lose a great all rounder in limited over format. we already saw how bad was WC final without Hardik.  
Shame on MI management, even after all this fiasco. they need to sit with rohit, hardik and sort it out like mature men, bunch of childish lunatics running a team."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"It really is, god damn. No faith whatsoever.

I mean, I'm no fan of the guy either, but this level of hate is only gonna make everything worse. If he gets demoralized, MI gets screwed even more. There's absolutely no upside to it."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,I will still stick to the fact that Hardik is not at all at the fault. Although he has some ego issues still he is not to blame for this situation. MI management is at the fault!!!!!
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,The Indian team captain is not captaining his IPL side that he won 5 trophies for in favor of someone who is an overglorified hack without any major performances to back him. Tell me now is there a level of hate that is unwarranted?
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I don't support hatred
But he should not be the first bowler when u have bumrah as gun player with you"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"honestly.. There were always rohit fans. But as far as I know, there were no die hard kind of fans for him. Only this year I'm hearing some buzz around him. 
People do appreciate hardick. But not sure what's going wrong rn"

PR 101"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"one problem is that because of whatever ""requirement"" pandya has the indian captain is not captaining his IPL side, bumrah who clearly wanted to bowl in the start is not getting that chance, hurts to see two very established and senior players being treated like this."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"IPL is all about Money. Given that he is having so many injuries, he understands he has limited time so better to go for best deals ."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I think this is a sign that the game is growing. Players who run after money have gotten this kind of welcome in football a lot.  (not saying it is wrong, but be prepared for what will come) And it just makes the game even more enjoyable. Pandya is getting hate because of thee way it happened and it doesn't help that he wasn't already a very likable player. The word chhapri feels very derogatory but Idk why it suits perfectly to him."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Bro doesn't watch football then he will know what real hate for players is. 
Indian fans are still very soft according to football ultras."

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,People like to shit on Pandya for choosing money over loyalty. The same people don't care about their favourites  taking money from gambling companies or tobacco companies to appear in their ads. Morality is subjective for some people.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,he deserves it from gujrat fans because he left them. all the other people hating on him are just people who don't understand that the owners of MI approached him and gave him the captaincy. anyone his position would accept a pay bump and the captaincy offer.

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,No I second you. I would also like to add that we need this guy if we have to win the T20 WC. But if this senseless trolling from 16 year old chapris affects his confidence then National team will suffer. I hated BCCI for hosting IPL before WC and my hate keeps growing with every match.

the fans would have had absolutely no problem to welcome pandya back in the squad but to have traded green, offered captainship with an undisclosed amount is what the problem is. the ""one family"" concept makes zero sense with a situation like this and pandya, sadly, is receiving what the management sown for"

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"The hate would have sufficed easily if he would’ve acted better, made better captaincy decisions. Also, the MI management should’ve a proper counselling session with Hardik and Rohit (if not done until now) 
If both of them behave normally with each other on the pitch, as they used to do, the hate would be less."

And his casual attitude is not working either. 

And seriously the way he has captained mi in 2 matches was so miserable omg"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,the only reason hardick pandya is playing and got captaincy is because of neeta ambani everyone knows this. this guy is nothing but a gimmick.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I don't think the hate for Hardik is because of his batting skills. He is an exceptional player, and there is no doubt about it. The only reason why he got most of the hate is because of his transfer from GT to MI ( who scaled more money). I mean, why. GT won a cup and has an amazing team to defend all situations."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"This isn't about him failing as a captain alone imo.

Previously, he had explicitly criticised MI and called it a team which brings in all the star players on board when Bumrah and Hardik himself are examples of MI nurturing youngsters. Rohit Sharma also addressed this during one of their press meets and even if one chooses to ignore the authenticity of those arguments, this was enough to enrage the fans of the franchise. 

After ridiculing MI, he agrees to return but only if he is made the captain. This isn't wrong per se, but if not Rohit Sharma, MI had Bumrah or SKY who were next in line for the captaincy and had been loyal to the franchise for years.

Lastly, nobody's denying the fact that he is a skilled player and would make it into the playing XI anyday. But as an individual, he still isn't mature enough. Fake accent and smile during the post match presentations is fine, but in the process of mimicking Dhoni, Kohli, Rohit etc, he's losing his own personality."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I think this is a culmination of years of his tomfoolery.

Remember his 'sophisticated talks' on Koffee with Karan? Or, denying Tilak a 50. Then his arrogance after losing games with statements on the lines of ""it feels nice to be unique"". Now this whole transfer saga. And on top of that he's not backing it with his performances. If you want to replace Bumrah as the numero uno, atleast try to be half as good as he is. Overall there is not one fixed reason to hate HP. It's a cesspool of bad decisions, and now people are just enjoying themselves with this hate ride."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,Completely deserved. When you start focusing on things other than cricket the same media which helped you exponentially should also bring you down at the same rate for being entitled ar*ehole

But its not fair to give character certificates based on rumours and gossips, zabardasti ka news channel jaisa controversy dhund rhe hn abhi.. just to villify an easy target and gush out their resentment towards everything wrong in their lives, on him.."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,I think it was expected and not too unfair. I am neither a MI fan nor a Rohit fan. But I do feel that he has been carrying a disrespectful demeanor for too long now.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,I don't understand why someone would hate him for transferring? I mean irl people would take 30% hike and shift companies. What's the problem here?
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Ambanis PR at work it seems... suddenly everywhere an article is popping up saying Hardik is being over abused....

Remember him abusing his team mates for not bringing him water during India's match? Remember him abusing Shami in GT match? Remember him abusing juniors as T20 captain in India's match? He also misbehaved with Rohit and Malinga at the start of this season.

Moreover he left MI for captaincy and now has comeback for captaincy. He is a pure power hungry person who abuses his power as captain. 

He is oversmart, rude and thinks very highly of himself and believes others are below him. Remember koffee with Karan? ""Aaj mein karke aaya""....

He deserves all the abuses...."

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Only gt fans being angry at him is justified...iske alava sab bina wajah hi karre, ruturaj bhi to csk ka captain bana no one's trolling him right?... it's just that mi's management fucked up, I don't think so it's his mistake there. Also looking at indian team perspective hardik being a captain in a franchise is a no brainer man. Moreover, captaincy was taken away from virat as well, and that too INDIAN TEAM CAPTAINCY, and you'll just find virat standing on the boundary lines in odi and t20 matches, so meme pages feeling sad for Rohit cuz he had to stand on the boundary rope is just stupid imo"

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I think this hate is going out of hand. He doesn't do anything wrong.
Due to the missed communication between mi management ,hardik and rohit.

I think rohit or Mi Management should release statements regarding this  issue."

And then come back to RCB when RCB starts winning trophies 
How RCB fans will look like ??"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I think the main reason for this is that he is the captain of a team, and when all his teammates performed, everyone expected him to do so as well. And he under delivered. If he would have atleast tried for a few more boundaries within lesser balls, then MI definitely came close to winning. In fact, maybe they might have even won if Pandya had at least worked for a half century. MI lost the game by 31 runs, which actually was closer than expected. Let's say Hardik Pandya played better and worked for the runs he might not have gotten out at 24 runs for 20 balls when others are able to get the same with an over less. So definitely he had to do more and is expected to do so especially being the team captain."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Too many Pro-Pandya posts lately across Social Media. Looks like MI is trying to do some damage control. 

This is not hate. It's Pandya's luck that Indian fans have gone too soft over last two decades. Otherwise he would have quit before even playing first game.."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"India has two clutch players...kohli and hardik...and both of their mental heaths were compromised because of Rohit's insecure fans....he doesn't give a damn...cause even if Rohit scores a duck...his fans and Mumbai lobby will call it a generational knock..

  
Just like how they overhyped scoring 30-40 runs in powerplay against a hard ball by calling it greatest act in cricket history while KL Kohli playing the tough overs against soft balls and 4 fielders in the boundary were called statpadders."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,He needs to play boring cricket and stop doing weird things. People will forget about him in a week. He brings attention to himself with his actions and words. Say the PR talking points in the interviews and bat and bowl by the book for your first season in the new club.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"No one would have hated him and MI management, if he was brought in and made captain in proper way. The way it was all done shows clear disrespect to Rohit."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I think it's just the way this entire captaincy was handed over caused alot of backlash. Had Rohit come out and sorta passed the Buck onto Hardik as the next gen etc I think the response wouldn't be like this.

More than anything it was just horrendous marketing and management by MI that has ruined both the player and franchises name. Could have been done in a classier way."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Everyone is mad how MI handled this and  fans are directing their hate towards Pandya, who makes it easier for them with his attitude."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"In this time when everyone is opposing him, if u make content/meme/video around it... It will sell, attract a lot of traction. That's the main reason of this Hardik Hate Trend now a days."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I'd say it's extremely amplified however, this is something he needed to prepare for. He made decisions that were in his best interests and that left GT and MI fanbase against him. If MI starts winning, the hate will reduce and if he wins the cup, the same people shitting on him will bend over backwards.

That said, he won't reach Sachin or Dhoni levels of stardom no matter what he does from now. The reason is that he has shown that he lacks loyalty. Rohit and Kohli are popular partly because they have been loyal to their IPL franchises in addition to ICT. Since people have a clear idea about Hardik's attitude and self-interest, he's harder to root for in a lot of people's eyes."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"He isn't the hardik pandya he used to be 

Previously (his initial years in MI), he was being used as a pure finisher. He had those solid bat swings and body balance. 

After injury, he understood that's not happening again. He became more sort of selfish player. Trying to establish himself as middle order 3/4/5th number batsman. He has really improved in bowling but, eventually more bowling will lead him to injury issues. 

So in today's picture, he is pretty average player considering other options. He can give you 30+ balls fifty unlike 18/19 he used to give. And most prominent reason he is getting hate is because he is using that captaincy role for his own selfish motive and he is doing that openly. He just want to have control over his part of batting and bowling. 

Management should be the one who get bashed. They will realise this when players like Bumrah and Surya will choose to enter auction pool rather than getting retained!"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"His captaincy has been baffling too right ?
Hate is now getting a bit out of hands. And I actually felt bad for him. I hope people stop now.

But also, I hope Pandya learns his lessons. First, don't take fans for granted. Second don't take digs at those who supported you come this far (it reflects poorly on you), and lastly when on a high, or especially when on a high, mind your words and actions. The day you come down they're ready to pounce on you. 

Then next, I hope Akash and Nita Ambani learn their lesson. One, don't interfere in cricketing matters, Two , money is not everything. That works in business, not in Showbiz. Third, don't take fans for granted. Fourth you need to have players on board if at all you decide to interfere in cricketing matters. You are because they are. They make you. 

I don't know what more Pandya wanted that GT had not given him. A chance to build a team from scratch, as a local boy. And it worked so well. He actually got a chance to build a legacy of his own there and had started so well!
So probably a lesson for all of us, if you're already doing good, don't be greedy. Mental peace, respect, fulfilment are more important."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,In MIs case Rohit seemed like he was sacked as Captain but that did not happen with CSK and Jaddu. Could have planned the transition better but lets wait and see still early stages of the game.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,this is a part of indian sports where cricket is a religion. In other countries no single player is worshipped and it is purely based on talent.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,By the time MI will start winning Pandya would have undergone some surgery and would have posted insta story of him dressed in hospital gown and watching MI win on TV in iCU
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"He had an opportunity to establish a lasting legacy with GT akin to Rohit with MI, Dhoni with CSK, or Kohli with RCB. However, he got lured by Ambani's money and threw away his only shot at making a name for himself."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Not to an extent brother

All it took for this drama to even never begin is to sit with rohit and pray to him that he leaves captaincy on his own will for his last year 

Just one public statement from rohit about giving the keys of mi to hardik is his own choice would've settled everything

But they managed to upset one if the biggest player of india, rohit is clearly not happy"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Tbh I don't have any problem with Pandya accepting this deal.

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,He was experimenting and that was required. He was also experimenting way before the T20 World Cup keeping that in mind. Why would one laud Dhoni's weak team ke against score karke kya fayda but hate on this from Hardik?
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,">there’s nothing wrong in asking for the captaincy. 


And kohli fans still hate rohit even when he didnt ask for captaincy from bcci lol and try to formulate their own theories to harm rohit image even when he had 5 ipl trophies and asia cup with nidhas trophy lol"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,Agree with you 100%
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,Looking at how he has handled MI in the last two games it's pretty obvious that Nehra and Gary Kirsten are behind all GT's last two season successes and not Pandya.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Hardik is not at fault for selling himself out to a franchise that kicked him on his arse for money and leaving the franchise that saw him as a captain and gave him a stage to prove himself

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"You aren't wrong. Rohit has not led by example in a long while. His skills are aligned with his age. It is not that different to Polly during the last couple years of his IPL career. High risk, diminished reward. They were and are in the line-up because it is felt owed to them. 

Rohit is not showing the team is bigger than him. The more this happens, the more it impacts the team negatively. Ultimately, Rohit will tarnish his legacy if this goes on. It will really hit the fan when Hardik has the courage to pick a better player to start. A healthy SKY is a better option than Rohit right now. What happens when that choice gets made?"

This move by Hardik ensures that not one but 2 franchisee fans hate him to the core now. Did more harm than good. And even if it was about money, his seniors Rohit, Kohli and Dhoni made more money than him just by being loyal and building their legacies!"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,Yup after serving notice period and following all legal paper work to the dot. Then there is no issue.
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"You don’t know how league football works, it’s much bigger than world cup and people are extremely attached to their respective clubs regardless of nationalities. Figo’s nationality had nothing to do with the whole incident, he would have gotten same treatment if he was spanish."
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"Enough with the Luis Figo, man. Yes, people treated him worse, but that doesn't make it right. The fans took it too far in both cases. Stop trying to normalize this behaviour."

comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"How on Earth did MI kick him out!! Rohit, Bumrah and SKY were 3 undroppable names and before MI had a chance to buy him back in auction he was already drafted. Absolutely zero doubt MI would have gone 15-20 Crores for Pandya if he was in (or maybe lesser as he had a dip in form back then)"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,">Rohit as a captain has been underperforming with the bat for many seasons, and at times with m

First nobody in mi works like that they all perform in one or two matches most. Mi was always about team performance and rohit had results and 5 trophies lmao with high performances in clutch sutuation like 2 50s in finals lol. Dont compare"
comment,Am I the only one or  the amount of hate towards Hardik is being amplified unnecessarily?,831,"I felt so for this particular game. It was. Maybe Hardik Pandya might have been receiving hate before as well, but this game just aggravated it even more. Especially under these circumstances. Also, before moving to GT, Hardik was well loved in MI even though he might not have been the captain then. He led GT to a winning season in 2022."

Using another footy analogy , he is the neymar of cricket.  Indisciplined , unprofessional and so injury prone that one feels he is made of glass .

Meredith is still raw. Nortje can be wayward. Wood is decent, has been in form and did well in the WC. Alzarri has been bowling well lately. He could be a left field choice. Mustafizur surely a great asset if he is available. Milne Henry Abott nope. Holder on big ground is a good pick. His batting, fielding will be asset too. Pattinson I think should be the one. He is easily the best powerplay bowler among all the options. He is a wicket taker similar to Cummins. Kesrick nope, Plunkett is past his best."

comment,Jofra Archer will not be made available for IPL 2020 : ECB,87,"Tanvir wasn't among the best overseas players. There is a reason I didn't include the likes of Akhtar, Gul and Asif in my comment. Even Unadkat is among India's best fast bowlers and has represented India at the senior level.

comment,Jofra Archer will not be made available for IPL 2020 : ECB,87,"> Tanvir wasn't among the best overseas players. 

He was. He wasn't as good as the others, but he was pretty damn good, look up his t20 record, it's very good. Also, this was back in 2008(9?), IPL was nowhere near as popular as it is right now. 

> Even Unadkat is among India's best fast bowlers and has represented India at the senior level. 

He's not among India's best bowlers, he was playing back when he was considered one of India's best, but he isn't anymore. If Unadkat was Pakistani, he'd have been a regular for a PSL team, but he wouldn't have been playing for Pakistan."
comment,Jofra Archer will not be made available for IPL 2020 : ECB,87,"Even Chris Gayle has been released from two different IPL teams during the course of his career.

Also, I fucking hate how much hate Pandya is getting tho, like it was MI who offered him money and captaincy, it was MI who didn't check with Rohit, if anyone was in Pandyas place, they would gladly take an extra 50 crore (unconfirmed under the table money he got) and a captaincy for his favorite franchise. Blame the game not the player tbh. I so wish he wouldve clutch this innings tbh"

The hatred is because the success of MI can be attributed to its fans, and when the owners pull such shit on its fans, they deserve to be told how wrong of a decision it was.

I hope management realises that you can antagonise an entire fan base for a player who literally shat on you through his comments.

P.S. Give the captaincy to Bumrah if handing over the reins to next generation is so important"

comment,Mumbai Indians in opening games at IPL ,1121,"Yes. The original Sanskrit meaning of parampara is more along the lines of lineage. However, it also has the additional meaning of 'tradition' which is the sense that Hindi borrows.    
Another Sankrit word sampradaya is borrowed by some other languages (like Kannada) as tradition.    

Sanskriti in Hindi is culture, borrowed as is from Sanskrit."

comment,Mumbai Indians in opening games at IPL ,1121,MI and CSK are known for great comebacks sure but one can't deny KKR's insane comeback in 2014 and 2021. Those are easily the best. Infact KKR's insane run in 2014 was undefeated till Raina stopped them at champions trophy final

Bowled an over of the new guy in the middle for 13 when the game was going smoothly and he was our seventh bowler. Why?

Saved bumrah till the fourth over. Why? 

Saved coetzee till the 11th. Why? 

Gave our best bowler from last year , chawla 3 overs only. Why? 

Didn't even play our best pace bowler from last year, madhwal. Why? 

Chose an underperforming brevis over wadhera , when he has finished a couple of games for us. Why?"

comment,Mumbai Indians in opening games at IPL ,1121,">Guy saved one over of luke wood, a powerplay bowler for the end , why?.

He's a full time bowler probably trusted him to bowl at the end.

>Saved bumrah till the fourth over. Why? 

Matchup he's got gill out three times. Also bumrah only bowls 1 in the PP anyway.

>Saved coetzee till the 11th. Why? 

Coetzee never bowls in the PP for any team. He always bowls in the middle phase.

>Gave our best bowler from last year , chawla 3 overs only. Why? 

Because pacers were bowling well? Maybe he could have given the wood over to him that's about it.

>Didn't even play our best pace bowler from last year, madhwal. Why? 

Who drops out?

>Chose an underperforming brevis over wadhera , when he has finished a couple of games for us. Why?

Foreign batter.....kya bol rha hai be"
comment,Mumbai Indians in opening games at IPL ,1121,">Saved bumrah till the fourth over. Why?

Bumrah isn't actually a great PP bowler. Since 2017 he averages 28 in the PP.  He's better than Hardik in any universe but PP is his weakest phase of play. In fact he's not his best in the first 11 overs. He averages 28 from 1-11. And 17.5 from 12-20."
comment,Mumbai Indians in opening games at IPL ,1121,"> Who told u that Rohit is happy??

Did Rohit call to tell you he was unhappy?

He looked fine in the field, he was even helping Hardik. A guy of Rohit's stature doesn't need money, if he was really that unhappy he would have left MI and gotten picked by another team in the auction."
comment,Mumbai Indians in opening games at IPL ,1121,"What is the meaning of ""our"" when your sack the most favourite captain of your fans without even giving a proper sandoff there is no more our left in mi anymore the resone l started liking Rohit shrma was mi because he won us a trophy but then you sack him out of nowhere just because of some person who left your team and started ranting about your team. I can't even understand what mi management was thinking did they really think that people are gona accept hardick after what he had said.

Doesn't it make sense to make him bowl early then ??? 

>Coetzee never bowls in the PP for any team. He always bowls in the middle phase.


Fair , but why wait till the 11th? Middle overs start from 7 , the spin didn't work out as much as they'd like it to have , so why wait ? 

>Because pacers were bowling well? Maybe he could have given the wood over to him that's about it.

There's one pacer you're forgetting, and that is Hardik pandya himself. There were two overs he shouldn't have bowled after the first one.  

>Who drops out?

Luke wood. Or shams mulani. 

>Foreign batter.....kya bol rha hai be

Brevis averages *18*  in SA20 , his home country's T20 game. He hasn't had a single good tournament since the U19 wc 3 years ago. 

I'd rather choose a proven talent ,who helped Punjab win the last Syed mushtaq Ali trophy  if I'm not wrong , than someone who's averaging less than Rohit did during the 2022 season"
comment,Mumbai Indians in opening games at IPL ,1121,"Not only his SR was dismal, he starved Rohit of all the strike.. Rohit opened, Brevis came in at no. 4.. When Rohit was out, he had faced less balls that Brevis. Did you watch the match or arguing based on score sheet?"

Also his average in PP is high became teams try to see him off"

comment,Mumbai Indians in opening games at IPL ,1121,"I'm fine with this.

In fact if MI plans to part with Rohit soon anyways, then might as well have let him go this season itself and kept Green instead. Trading Rohit to that supposed offer from DC would've ensured he doesn't go to CSK in the mega auction, win.

I did say this.

>He's better than Hardik in any universe  

Honestly I don't have a lot of issue with Hardik bowling in the PP. You'd probably want 2-3 from Wood in the PP, 2 from Hardik and maybe 1 from Bumrah and Cotzee. 

> Also he gave Luke wood , a powerplay specialist left armer , 1 over in the powerplay . Why?

This I agree with. This was stupid from Hardik."

You said gill is weak to him , he got Saha out ... If gill had gotten out earlier wouldn't that have been 20-30 runs lesser on the target ? 

>Spinners were doing a solid job. You're just nitpicking now.

One guy went for 13 

The other guy took a wicket but got hit for 31 I believe

The last guy went for 24 and didn't take a wicket in 3 over

How is this a solid job ??


>He literally bowled a good over before that one.

He bowled a good over before the first over where he went for 11 runs??? HUH ? 

>Foreign player. Spinner like come on.

Where is it written that we have to play 4 foreign players ? Heck we didn't even play 4 foreign players in the first innings. 

The spinners weren't working well , he went for 34 runs in 3 overs.  I'd rather have a wicket taking pace bowler in his place. 


>Literally played well today WTF are you talking about. Blame Tilak and Tim for refusing singles WTF.


Yes , he played well when Rohit was with him. After that lost all steam ,got scared and got out at a 121 strike rate. Nobody remembers how you studied for the exam , only the result. 


>Literally played well today WTF are you talking about. Blame Tilak and Tim for refusing singles WTF.

About that

Tell me why did they send Tim David , who averages around 9 against leg spin when Rashid khan still had overs to bowl? Hardik knows Rashid , he's played against him in the nets for 2 years... Why did he hold himself back ? Why didn't he take responsibility if the coach stopped him from going forward ?"

Mere Bhai Gill is weak to Hardik which is why he opened the bowling."
comment,Mumbai Indians in opening games at IPL ,1121,"Okay that explains over number 1 , maybe.. because I don't remember gill getting out to hardik in the powerplay.

Why did he give himself the second over then ?"

post,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,N/A
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"I'm convinced that Narine has a legitimate and chucking action available to himself at all times. If things start going south, he can just chuck a couple and bowl the rest properly. At that point, there's nothing to go off of other than match footage because he can just bowl properly in a test"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,At least the BCCI have so much money that a tech like all bowlers wearing patches on their arm to check for chucking should not be unfeasible.
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"truth is it's hard to check if a bowler exceeds 15 degrees of flexion in the elbow based on a 2d image as you've posted here. 

Because the arm moves in 3d space. 

If you take an L shape and rotate, it looks straight when looking straight on. 

Some bowlers have a bent elbow that stays bent during the delivery (i.e. doesn't fully extend to 180 degrees or beyond). So when these guys' arms rotate, it gives the false impression that it's straightening, when it might not be. 

I'm not commenting on Narine's action here but the fact that people think they can tell whether a bowler is chucking or not based on a photo or a television screen. 

When bowlers get tested they put movement trackers on to track the movement in 3d.

Honestly the whole rule is a mess by ICC. they need to come up with a consistent plan to test all bowlers on set intervals."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"If I am being honest, it does look like he is chucking from this image. However, these 2D images don't show the real picture and it's difficult to ascertain the actual extent of the bending of the arm. 

If he has actually been doing it, then why has no one from the umpires to the opposition teams called him out yet? He did remodel his action in 2020 and since then he hasn't been that effective with the ball but never got questioned so far until he delivered a match winning performance."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,His batting was Sus too last night. Like how can he play like this on a slow pitch? He should be banned for his batting too. And KKR should be banned too.

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Kohli played him fairly well yesterday otherwise had he gotten out early, there would've been a rampage online demanding Narine to be banned! That being said, I don't think his action is legal and it's been like this for quite a while now"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,I've been watching him for the last two IPL games he's played. IMO i think he's chucking again and someone should let him know.
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Teams are not dumb. If they report him now this early in the tourney, kkr will rest him and play him again in playoffs are near the end for deciders.

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Crazy how so many people have jumped to the conclusion that Narine is a chucker, based on a few 2d images

Umpires should call him out if they feel he's chucking /opposition teams should report his action, I'm sure other teams analysts comb over Narine footage throughout the season."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"This is ridiculous. If you guys think this is chucking you need to see Rashid Khan's bowling from the same angle. 

If he is chucking why are umpires and match referees and heck even opposition teams are not reporting him? Do you think other franchises are dumb enough to let him bowl with an unfair advantage?Also, he remodeled his action 3 years ago why didn't it come to anyone's knowledge before this season?

He had an issue with his bowling actions where certain variations would make his arm bend more than the permissible limits. He sorted it out and remodeled his action after crossing 30, which isn't easy.

One boundary less spell and you guys call him a chucker!"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Ever since they changed the method by which bowling actions are assessed it seems like it's been open slather, especially for well known bowlers. We see so many dodgy actions these days.

I want them to bring in a bowling sleeve type thing that can measure the amount of flex live for the umpires to call a no ball. Stop this nonsense where they go for testing and just don't throw it for a little bit. Because rarely is it every ball, just some."

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"This is one of those things that technology can easily fix. We attach a couple of sensors to a bowler's arm . And for a year or so you just monitor every bowler. To get a confidence interval of how often a bowler ""chucks"" in a match. It's most likely not gonna be 0. And once we have that, we can then tell the bowlers, we monitor the bowling arm, if your elbow exceeds more than 15 degrees x number of times or more you'll be required to change it."

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"He should just be banned for a season or two and ask to completely remodel his action. He knows he can’t chuck in internationals so he’s just sticking to T20 leagues but if he’s banned from there too maybe he’ll take it seriously.

Yeah, I'm an SRH Fan and always have been an SRH Fan, I think anybody can Criticise an Individual about their professional Credibility, If there is a report and I am proven wrong I would happily take that I just want a Fair tournament that's it.

Having said that, Narine did get called for his action in 2020 (even when wasn’t being considered for international cricket). So there was a time where he was under the pump and had to remodel his action a little. 

My guess would be that his action is probably on the edge with whether it’s legal or not. And because he doesn’t try to play intl cricket, it isn’t looked at with as much scrutiny."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"I agree it looks suspect but there’s not enough evidence from those shots to say conclusively. You really need the side on from the last frame to be sure.

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Other way round. When he first got called he had multiple variations with very similar and hard to pick releases. He then had to remodel his action so ended up with two totally different variations but this time with very different grips, making them easier to pick, even before he started his action.

I dont have the list handy, but there was quite a few bowlers that had a certain degree of flexion in the arm.  the law was not changed/made to accomodate Murali but for the other bowlers to fall in aswell.

Murali's anatomy created an illusion of chucking, but he could never fully extend his arm"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Murli's wasn't a pass you dumb dumb.
He went to ICC and they did all the tests on him and he was proven to be not chucking.
It's his natural body makeup that he used to bowl that way in comparison to Sunil who is chucking intentionally."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Murali didn't get an inexplicable pass??? He was subjected to biomechanics tests multiple times before being cleared. Yes a rule was created to accomodate such actions, but in no way did he get a free pass, if anything he was called multiple times by umpires before the tests."

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,Some balls like doosra for example can only be bowled at a reasonable speed if you chuck unless you're Murali or Saqlain. So it gives you a great advantage.
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,There's no way you could accurately measure the angle of a bowler's arm using the cameras at a match if they're wearing long sleeves
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,We have the technology to film 2 angles on match day
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"The thing is virtually no bowler in the planet will deliver with a completely straight arm. There's some degree of flex which is why 15 degrees is now the allowable limit. Apart from leg spin, it is virtually impossible to bowl with a perfectly straight arm.

Chucking is determined by the change in angle of the elbow which is why 2D images like this aren't very good. Yes there's definitely a change in the angle of his elbow and given Narine's history yes it's probably gonna be pushing the limit. But I'm still gonna laugh at all these Reddit ""experts"" who think a bunch of still images is better proof than the proper biomechanical tests"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"ICC did take action and Narine hasn’t played for West Indies since then. 

Not because he isn’t good enough, but because of his action."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"The ICC have nothing to do with the IPL. All the ICC could do is have the umpires call his action in an international game then get it tested, but since he doesn't play internationals, they're powerless"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"I think they will...otherwise every spinner will try chucking. Like many pointed out , he's barely saving himself by the 15degree rule"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"He already did it in 2014 and Narine, Ajmal and rest of the chuckers were banned quickly lmao. Hope he wears full sleeves again and blatantly chucks against KKR"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Usually bans last a few matches only. IPL is a long tournament with 14 matches per team. So if he gets reported now he may miss lets say 5-6 games, with him being one of KKRs talismans, he ll be back in time for the deciders. But if he is reported around the 10th - 12th game lets say that ll be a body blow if KKR is fighting for a playoff spot. Or, if they are doing really well in the early phase, he might get reported earlier. Teams with their analysts might already have plans for this. Its a no brainer. If we can see that he is chucking, analysts whose only job is to analyze the game and come up with tactics will have already unraveled this one- may be even to the extent of when exactly he might chuck and force one out. This one is coming soon for sure."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Many can bowl boundary less spells but here we are talking about a legend of the game and by these allegations you try to take away the credit from him. And no he is not known to be a chucker as I said few of his variations were making his arm be bent more than the permissible limits. It's not like he was chucking on purpose.

Given the number of variations he had it's obvious a couple might get sus.

And from the above images IT DOES NOT look like he's chucking. Once his arm is bent he keeps it that way till the ball is delivered."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Lol the pic that OP posted is from KKR vs SRH match. He finished the match with figures of 19/1 in 4 overs.

If it was that easy for him to chuck on purpose then you are indirectly saying all the other IPL teams are dumb by not bringing it to the notice of officials."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"IPL is now as big as International Cricket they should scrutinize his action closely because Narine is the Match Winner of KKR and could cost other teams trophies, they should form a special committe"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,That's why I suggested having a confidence interval. If the average bowler chucks 3 balls in 4 overs. You just make that the standard. And if a bowler exceeds it. You tell them to sort it out. If they don't you ban them for a bit.

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,If he doesn’t want to bowl properly then Idc if his career is over. Chucking gives an unfair advantage to him and his team. He can pick up baseball or anything if he just wants to chuck.

It is easy to allege someone of chucking. And if SRH has complained then it should be in the media by now."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"The tests they did were also recorded and broadcast. You can watch them. Very clearly shows his arm being bent well past the allowed angle while mark nicholas randomly says how its fine when its obviously not. Its an inexplicable pass… Go actually watch the footage, use a protractor and explain how more than 45 degrees is legal."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Those tests are on YouTube and prove absolutely nothing. It’s a case of complete and utter false equivalence. Just because he can badly bowl a ball well wide, short and down leg with a ‘metal’ brace that very clearly still bends it clears him of chucking by definition in numerous games? It’s absurd. Get out the protractor and look for yourself. These tests aren’t secret. They are all over the internet and I would employ you to look in to them yourselves and come up with your own determinations instead of just swallowing what ICC tells you happened. Watch the footage and think about how controlled tests are done. Murali being given a pass is a farce and a hill I’m happy to die on because at the end of the day, I’m a stickler for facts and reason two things not used in the slightest by people defending murali. Awesome, friendly dude, still chucks though sorry."

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,So people hypothetically complaining about 2 bouncers is the reason why this rule was established?
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,I don’t think it’s immediately evident to the batter. They’re looking at the ball in the fingers and not the bent of the arm. Only footage can help

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"he can bowl with his legal action in the testing phase and back to his chucking action on the field, that's possible too. if im not wrong, a person who is suspected to have an illegal action must get reported for at least 2 times before getting banned from ipl for that season."

Surely a ban should last untill proven otherwise."

on purpose or not, it's still chucking. although i ain't accusing the person who's one of the best spinners as a chucker but his action is quite suspicious in the above images."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Relax buddy, I’m sure Narine’s wise enough to go through extensive testing that he fits the 15 degree bending mark after being called so many times.

Getting reported for your action practically ruins your career (which he’s been through multiple times). Unless some higher ups pay officials money (which is a terribly huge conspiracy), I think Narine must’ve put enough effort to make his action legal."

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"You can bend your elbow as long as you don't stretch it while delivering the bowl. Murali can't straighten his hand, which is why chucking never applied for him."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,No. Totally 100% incorrect!!! All fast bowlers hyperextend their elbows it’s impossible to do deliberately and it’s flexing the wrong way.
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,Because murali didn't Chuck. One needs to straighten the elbow while delivering the ball for it to be chucking. Murali literally can't straighten his elbow.
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"That’s only cos the rules were made around him. 
And when he was tested in Oz when he was legal he was bowling low 40s. He never bowled that slow in tests. Also suggesting he was never legal in matxhes"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,I agree. I think the amount of discussion a couple of blurry frames from the broadcast is a bit silly. If his action is that bad then the other teams will be agitating for it to be called anyway
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"If they suspect that Narine has changed his action in testing by comparing video footage, then they'll ban him anyway."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"I mean any time in the franchise would take Narine if they could. The last thing they care about is a moral qualm like that.

And personally, I’d argue there’s nothing wrong ethically with him pushing his action as much as he can to take advantage of the law. It’s also fair if he gets called for his action (which he was in 2020) and has to go through the pressure of remodelling it again. 

Plus, because he’s been called (even when he wasn’t being considered for international cricket) my guess is that he’s remodelled it just enough to be legal, or thereabouts legal."

comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,Hmmmm......poor IPL officials can't even report/warn him when common people on the internet can confirm he's action is suspicious by looking at a 2D image!
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,Yeah he will go through a lot of testing to fit into that bending mark but what's the use if he keeps bowling like this in normal matches
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"It's not so simple. Firstly, no you can't bend your elbow even if you don't straighten it. The rules are not clear on that.
Secondly, he was initially cleared by ICC with the logic that you mentioned, that he had a defect and couldn't straighten his elbow. How much was it bent, they never confirmed (although there were lot of speculations around it)
Thirdly, he was subsequently, and much later, still banned by ICC from bowling the doosra on grounds that he straightened his elbow (they released the figure of just under 15⁰). This clearly meant they suspected him of straightening *beyond* his default bend caused by the birth defect.
They later allowed him to bowl by changing the rules and allowing up to 15⁰ bending/straightening.
And on top of this, he had an hyperextensive arm joint (at the shoulder) that allowed him to get an extra few degrees of angle at the shoulder to get more revvs on the ball. This is why his regular off spin delivery also fizzed like a wrist spinners..because it wasn't just regular finger spin.
In my opinion, he was a freak genius bowler ...but he did bend the elbow beyond the birth defect, to bowl the doosra. But so did everyone who bowled doosra. In fact so did most pacers to (to an allowable limit)."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,Is that why scientific testing showed he can and he did. His layers made him play the disability card.
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,">That’s only cos the rules were made around him. 

No they weren't, they were amended because when they tested him they realised the mast majority of professional bowlers 'chucked' by the letter of the law. Natural human hyperextension is 10 - 15°

Forget Murali and spin, if the rules weren't amended, Akthar, Lee and pace fiends after them wouldn't have had a career."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"He should be permanently banned now surely?


You can't keep being asked to remodel your action and going back to the old action as soon as you are cleared infinitely"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,Her account had posted meme about BJP leaders being like mafia. Threatening corporations and wealthy people if they don't give money to bjp party through electoral bonds.
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"people can get suspicious by looking at images, it's not like we can stand in the middle of the field and observe his action. but it's unfair to confirm that he is indeed chucking based on a couple of images which are in 2d tho."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"The rules are perfectly clear. You're allowed 15 degrees of flex through your delivery.

In theory, I could run in with my arm at a right angle and if I could somehow get enough momentum in it to get the ball down the other end on a good length without straightening more than 15 degrees it would be perfectly legal.

The reason 15 degrees was chosen was because of a study undertaken during the 2004 Champions Trophy that found everyone to be chucking under the rules as written. The rule of zero elbow flex meant everyone was chucking because it is virtually physically impossible to bowl a cricket ball without some change in the angle of your elbow"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"This is a common misconception. Bend is fine, it’s only the degree of extension that matters. See https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/cricket/rules-and-regulations/illegal-bowling-actions. Many leg spin bowlers have bowled with bent arms beyond the 15 degrees and it’s fine, as they don’t straighten. Paul Adams might be the most famous example. 

The report you’re referring to showed that McGrath, Lee, and others extended up to 13 or 14 degrees. Murali had lower extension (<5 for this offie, 11 degrees for his doosra), but the old laws only allowed 5 degrees for spinners and 10 for seamers (the argument being: pacers arms go faster, so they extend more).

Having realized that many spinners arms are as quick as pacers, and that the pacer/spinner distinction created some ambiguity, e.g., cutters, arm balls, they set 15 degrees if extension as the universal limit. 

You can read more at https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/the-15-degree-question-136043?platform=amp"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,Hyperextention is something different though. It certainly can’t be done deliberately whereas spinners chucking it is
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Course he wasn’t. 😂

He chucked it to gain an advantage. For some  insane reason the icc brought in the 15deg rule and said he was legal. Then for a few years we had a load of blatant chuckers. Ajmal was the worst of the lot, can’t believe he took so long to get done. His arm was at like 90degrees."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"In franchise cricket he won't be reported. He brings in the moolah and has long stopped playing International Cricket, so I highly doubt whether ICC or for that matter even BCCI will take note of it and as a fellow SRH fan it irritates me too, but it is what it is."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"iirc Mendis wasn't involved in any suspected action controversy, guy was a true mystery bowlers. (Until that fateful test match against Sehwag)."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"I read this and don't see a problem with it, its some weird hand shape like malinga but malinga release point is above shoulder so its good as per law, whatever that I also don't see a problem with arm chucking a little bit"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,">For some  insane reason the icc brought in the 15deg rule and said he was legal

They brought in the rule because it turned out that literally every bowler in international cricket was also chucking to some extent (with the sole exception of Ramnaresh Sarwan). They either needed to ban every bowler, or amend the laws to accommodate this. They did the latter for obvious reasons."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,The funny part is that Murali in test conditions was averaging 14.7 degrees extension with +-1 degree error. So he was chucking a large percentage of deliveries even in the artificial non match day stress conditions. Imagine what he did in the middle when his team really needed a wicket. The entire testing mechanism is a joke because you can alter your action during testing and go back and chuck in a match.
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"I don't know why this is being upvoted because it's blatant misinformation. The entire point of the 15deg rule is because tons of bowlers had a flex in their actions, even pace bowlers like McGrath or Lee. There's so much discourse and documentation about Murali disproving this that honestly just get over it.

Agree with you on Ajmal, apparently he was flexing his arm like 40-50 degrees, he deserved to be banned"
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,He was called by CSK and dropped in 2014 champions trophy final where CSK thrashed them. Every team knows if Narine is chucking they'll Need to call him out on finals or playoffs only since in league stage they simply rest him
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Yeah right, its only when you pointed out kkr having a history of mystery bowlers did I really notice that fact, and the first mystery bowler that came to mind was Mendis and interestingly he has played for kkr too, that’s why I specified that. He was indeed a special bowler."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,The fact that Murali was called for chucking when he bowled legspin is proof that some people will never be satisfied and will call him a chucker no matter what.
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Because pace bowlers weren’t flexing their arms like murali. They were hyper extending. Something all quick bowlers do. It’s the elbow flexing past the perpendicular. It cannot be controlled unlike what Miami did. 

For those who say murali can’t straighten his arm, why can he bowl leggies with a straight arm? That was a myth perpetrated by him and his team to deflect away from the issue of throwing. Best he got on a lab was just under 15 degrees, bowling low 40s with little spin. In matches he bowled quicker and ragged it, probably hitting 20degrees."
comment,Bowling Action of Sunil Narine,619,"Is there a video of him bowling legspin with a straight arm?

Really like the guy but there will always be an asterisk beside his name for me."

comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"No thanks. The whole point of Asia Cup is that its meant to be Asian countries playing against each other **in Asia.** 

We don't want the colonisers to get involved in the one tournament they aren't a part of."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"UK? Sir, um, no...? UK is not the best country when it comes to cricket because of rain. London yes but only London. Other places it can rain a lot."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Dambulla has a lighting issue . Apparently the flood lights should be replaced and the process is goin on ryt now
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"I assume due to logistical reasons, it’s quite to hard to shift a match another ground at such short notice"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"I think this is more of a torture for the audience rather than the players. I went to uae for ipl and man, I will not go there again."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"absolutely dead atmosphere to watch on TV as well. such a boring country to play cricket in. slow tracks, dead air."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Asia Cup 2018 (ODI) was also held in UAE in September though
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"So what thd heat isn't that bad there, Pakistan were the ""home"" team there for years playing plenty of tests and odi's, plus all those odi's in Sharjah back in the 80s and 90s.

The players would take that dry heat over that horrible sticky humid heat you get in the subcontinent."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Play the Asia cup in the country it’s supposed to be in, if another team doesn’t like that for whatever reason, they drop out of the tournament"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,The hate against Sri Lanka is insane right now. I feel bad for these fools who think rained out matches aren’t part and parcel of the game
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"I live in Dubai. It is illegal to work outside in the UAE during 12:30pm to 3:00pm due to how hot it is. Infact this law is quite lenient as most companies that have outdoor work dont begin work until 4:30pm. It is absolutely ridiculous to ask players to take the field during such heat.

Sethi is speaking out of his ass. He should understand why UAE was not an option before making inane claims. Just half a match was lost. Not the end of the world."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Didn't know Najam Sethi was a weather supercomputer. Or was he doing the rain dance in his backyard for this tweet?
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,BCCI should legitimately just have dropped the Asia Cup and played bilaterals. Been saying this from the start
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"If you think Bangladesh would be better right now, I have some bad news for you about how the South Asian monsoon works..."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"He was back and served as chairman for a few months, he was responsible for the Asia cup and all the schedule was finalized under his management, then he left in july because of politics in Pakistan"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"His involvement in Pakistani politics make him a target for supporters of Imran Khan, the reason why he was removed in the first place.

For me, he has been one of the best PCB chairman we have had in a long time. He effectively brought international cricket back to Pakistan though PSL. Got to give him credit for that"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"This could work. Since Australia plays football together with other countries in Asia Cup, they could join too then"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Yeah but that's the point. U either boycott or play without restrictions. What's this ""I'll play with pak but only in certain conditions?"""
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"I get what you are saying but Sri Lanka won the final after losing the toss. So it’s not like it’s always a certainty 

UAE is far from perfect but it would have been better than this, the next Pak-Ind match also has 60% chance of rain"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Not happening. India won't come to Pakistan. Period. Enjoy the revenue from this year's Ind vs Pak matches and upgrade your stadiums for PSL. 

No hate towards the people from Pakistan, you very well know the reasons why it's not safe to play there."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Asia Cup 2018 was also held in UAE and that was ODI
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,You guys are okay playing in Kandy but Dambulla is where you draw a line? I don't understand like all of the things you mentioned it doesn't matter if the game is in Kandy?
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Lot's of complaints back then too and 2018 is precisely the reason no one agreed to play in UAE this time
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"It's been 5 years since 2018 and there was a 2 year long pandemic in there as well. Pre-covid, all teams played loads and loads of ODIs. The players were used to playing 3 match and 5 match ODI series. They were used to spending 7+ hours on the field. Ever since the pandemic, not only all the cricketers had to spend 2 years with minimal exercise and cricket due to lockdowns, there has been a sharp decrease in no. of ODIs. It's thier own fault for not having more ODIs but they can't just have a whole ass ODI tournament outta nowhere in that scorching heat. No player is prepared for that."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"TBH, I think India should have dropped the tournament and probably played a bilateral against another opposition.

Sethi still mentioned it should have been held in UAE not in Pakistan. Why though? 🤔"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"That was literally the option BCCI proposed. Either host it somewhere else or you can play without us.

India had no issue with dropping out of the tournament. The other nations had the issue because they knew the revenue and viewership would be far less with no India involved."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,I back you on this. I also live here and it’s hot as fuck. Expecting players to play over 100 overs of cricket is just ridiculous in these conditions.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Shocked to hear it is actually illegal. Qatar, UAE, and all gulf countries have workers from south Asian countries working in all types of conditions and many fatalities occurs as well. Sorry this isn't related to cricket but still wanted to bring it up. Do these companies just ignore those laws?"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Start the match at 5-6pm then. 
ODI matches usually last about 8 hours so it’ll be over be 1-2am. 

Sounds a bit extreme ,but I’m watching the US Open right now and the Center court matches end around the same time as well. 
So pro sports can be played that late."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Yea so if not Dubai, LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE. Point is why SL when u know the game would end up in a sure shot washout?"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,">What's this I'll play with pak but only in certain conditions

1:- We offered to not play, SLCB,BCB etc rejected it,coz they want that sweet INDIAN RS and Indian viewership.

2:- Do PCB has no shame? I mean it was their chance to host and they should have categorically refused to move it anywhere else, whether BCB OR SLC played/agreed or not.

Our stance has been clear since atleast a decade, we are forced to play in Icc tournis but we won't play on pak land till our democratically choosen govt doesn't allows."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Tbf they were basically on the verge of losing, we just decided to miss 3 catches on the same dude who got 70 runs and made it extremely easy for Sri Lanka to win (even after they conceded 10 runs before the first ball)"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Na. In Pakistan they have people living the high life with free food, oil, wine and women. Even Arabs are jelly. BCCI is jealous of how wealthy pcb. Hardik cries in his Lamborghini looking at Shaheens personal missile collection."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Yea obviously India won't go to Pak for obvious reasons. But the game could have been organised literally anywhere else where monsoon isn't ongoing. In pallekele, literally everyday has 90% chance of rain. Idk what they were thinking"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Pakistan has very good stadiums. 
Pindi
Multan
Karachi
Lahore

All stadiums have hosted international matches including that of AUS, ENG and NZ"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Your safety concerns are as legitimate as Deepika being an ISI agent. Multiple countries have visited Pakistan in the past year with no concerns. I know Pakistanis live rent free in Indians’ heads because of all the Bollywood movies constantly making it bigger than it is. 

Considering the lack of beef between Pak and SL, I’d put money that the attack was orchestrated by RAW agents."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"They have audacity to ask to move match from Ahmedabad because they think Ahmedabad crowd is not Muslim friendly? But want India to play in Pakistan where killing minority is just another Friday.

They keep saying keep politics away from sports bug the same time takes pride in Zia's cricket diplomacy and PCB is a political circus."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Occupation health and safety laws apply to white people only. For us lesser folks from the sub continent and Africa life is good if we are still breathing
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,It’s one of those things where common sense clashes with traditions. Classic cricket. Idk if there is logistical reason to not have it. If anything it’s better probably because the game starts near prime time which is around 7 ish so ads cost more.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,">Start the match at 5-6pm then. ODI matches usually last about 8 hours so it’ll be over be 1-2am.

It's still really hot"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,This is above BCCI’s payroll. The clearance is done by Indian government. If they don’t want Indian team to visit Pakistan there’s nothing BCCI can do.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Talking about 2018 here after IK came to power and I mean it was clear as day that him and IK weren't going to work. Khan hated him
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Tbh when it comes to tournaments, Sri Lanka almost always does well. Won’t be surprised if you guys win the Asia cup again."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Sure but if we go by that logic, then we were in trouble in the super 4 game against India despite winning the toss and might have lost if Arshdeep didn’t drop one of the easiest catches of all time.

I am not denying that toss plays a major role in UAE but it’s not like a team can’t win if they lose the toss.

Tbh anything would have better because right now there is a high chance a few other matches will be washed out too"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,India 5th largest economy doest have toiled but country begging for 1B is a paradise.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"What was more surprising was the fact that stadium wasn’t filled to its full capacity.

And I am really scared about the attendance figures of this year’s World Cup for non India matches owing to poor organisation by BCCI for everything ranging from scheduling to selling tickets. Everything at BCCI’s end is so mismanaged"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"India actually was willing to withdraw but Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal were not happy with that."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Pak would have come up with the statement India is scared and what not. Even Pak knows they need Ind for the revenue. Ind vs Pak is a blockbuster event and no way PCB will leave that.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,The safety concerns are very legitimate. India visiting Pakistan is a different case than other countries visiting Pakistan
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,I'll agree to whatever floats your boat. Goodnight. Will surely talk when Champions Trophy venue is also changed in the future! 😂
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,">Pakistanis live rent free in Indians’ heads because of ~~all the Bollywood movies~~ terrorist attacks every single day

FTFY.

They are not India.

Typical Pakistani. Blaming your faults on everyone else in the world."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Yet nothing like 2009 happened in india. Speaks a lot about state of Pakistan
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785, It sure if you are. Manipur has been in far far worse states on conflict in the past decades under various governments but none of us ever got to know about it.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Sethi was also talking about 2018 Asia cup which was ODIs
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,How swiftly did my man threw an insult as soon as someone tried to reason with logic and common sense
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,How on earth do you have a problem with playing cricket when it's rainy but not when it's literally dangerous to be doing outdoor work 😭😭😭
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,">Occupation health and safety laws apply to white people only.

I am an Indian and lived in Qatar, what you have said isn't true. Skilled workers are treated well no matter where you are from."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Why didn't Pakistan just stand their ground and refuse the hybrid model? After all, they're going to India for the World Cup aren't they?"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"
>What was more surprising was the fact that stadium wasn’t filled to its full capacity.

Well..they organise a sure shot wash out and expect people to fly from their countries to witness a washout? Not surprised tbh



>Everything at BCCI’s end is so mismanaged

Yeah couldn't agree more"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"How are you actually this stupid? You threw in a lazy potshot about the condition of stadiums, dude corrects the statement and you deflect to politics. 

Yani thori to aqal kar. Pata nai kahan se jahil uth kar aa jate ho."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,">But that's what happen when your national identity becomes increasingly driven by mindless sectarianism and jingoism

Hmmm....i wonder what happened in 2009?"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Additionally that would be too late for the Indian audience and I imagine the broadcasters wouldn't be too thrilled about that.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Because you cannot expect PCB a cricket board to fight a government.Also Asia cup isn’t an ICC tournament so if we pull out of World Cup we get penalized. If India pulls out of the 2025 ICC champions trophy which is being held in Pakistan they will be penalized as well.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,And yes it is hatred... hatred for Pakistan since Pakistan seems to live rent-free in your mind. There are two games left in Lahore for the Asia Cup. So enjoy.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"""we don't fund terrorists"". Go do some research on how TTP and BLA/BLF have been funded by India. It's no secret and tell your BCCI to let someone host this year's World Cup coz of what's happening in Manipur and all the different rapes, murders and lynchings happening in various parts of India."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Don’t fund terrorists? Yeah the Pakistanis dying from terror attacks daily are funded by Fiji I’m sure.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,">Something about comparing national tragedies doesn’t sit right with me.

But i wasn't comparing non cricket incident. 2009 like incident has never happened in india ever. A cricketing team bus shot down is a shocking incident. That alone makes pakistan on another level. Comparison with india is not possible.

>You Indians keep yapping about how Pakistan sponsors terrorism in India (which i agree with), but conveniently also forget that India has openly backed and supported terrorist groups and separatists movements across the border.

Honestly governments sponsoring anti groups in other countries is common everywhere (literally cold war was based on that) but when common citizens are targetted then pakistan terror groups are most successful than other countries. 

>India in contrast has been brainwashed by Hinduvta and have this weird anti-Pakistan mindset, so much so that Pakistan plays a crucial role in every single election in India.

Idk mate. The common indian in 1947 took the route of secularism. Correct me if am wrong, in pakistan any other religion apart from official doesn't have same rights does it? And there are continous terror attacks on other religion majority areas and shia areas right? Seems like hindutva term is used by you guys to avoid questions on your country's laws which don't have any rights for other religions"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"I mean I haven't played a test match in relentless heat but others have. Matthew Hayden took 6 months to recover, Akhtar blacked out after bowling 2 overs; doesn't seem like the smartest idea to torture the players like that. Just saying."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Indian prime time is the prime time in Asia cup. Rest of the countries are at half hour distance or the same as indian time anyways.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,I’d say anything that ends before 00:00 is fine for the Indian audience.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,IPL is T20. I believe it's a terrible idea( especially after DRS prolonging the match time this season) to start the match at 8 PM and end it at midnight. 7-7:30 pm should be brought back. You definitely don't want one days ending after midnight. Ratings always surge towards the end of an innings so you would want both those ends to happen when most people are free.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,What happened in 2009 mate?
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,It’s not hatred for Pakistan it’s hatred for the government and the army who are spoiling the name of Pakistani people by conducting terror attacks on india
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Literally the UN has said that pakistan is a major financier for terror groups like lashkar e Tabia JeM and many others and as far as rapes and murders are concerned I suggest that you first work on the atrocities on woman commuted in Pakistan before fingering india
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Yeah. Everything is funded by India. There is nothing that has to do with Pakistan openly supporting and funding terrorists and lying in bed with the Taliban.

You guys grow snakes in your backyard and then blame the neighbors when the snakes bite you in the ass."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"> revenue se uska socho aur loans pure karo

Yes, revenue from cricket are meaningful enough to contribute to loans. Again, how are you actually this stupid?  😂🤡

Anyways, this was another pathetic attempt at a petty dig. Not going to work though. 

> fir aana debate karne.

Debate what? Already walked you through how you're a complete clown. 

> Political reasons hi hai tabhi hi India nahi aa rahi Pakistan aur na hi aayenge aage.

Who is denying this? Basic reading comprehension nai aati? Bottle feed karun? Ya Urdu main samjhaoun? 😂

The argument is about you deflecting to political issues in unrelated comments when OP wasn't disputing it. 

> Aqal kisme kitni hai wo bolne ki zaroorat nahi hai.

I mean, it is indeed patently clear."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Well we did good in 2016.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Yeah but the original comment suggested ending it at 2am UAE time, which is 3.30am IST. To end at 12am IST, you need to end the game at 10.30pm UAE time, and start it at 2.30pm which is not feasible."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Yeah, that should have been the case. India was also fine with that but the other boards were not since the tournament wouldn't have been as profitable"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,">I am quite literally shia and criticize inhumane treatment of every single Pakistani. I don’t care if they are shia, sunni, ahmedi, hindu or christian.

Good to see.

>If you are a citizen it is the state’s responsibility to ensure your safety and rights. My entire point is that Pakistanis aren’t blind to the injustice happening in the country.

Nice.

>When churches are burned down or hindus are forced to marry most Pakistanis don’t go “But what about how India treats its minorities”, they say this is wrong and shouldn’t happen.

So they only say it's wrong? No changes made? So my point is correct that india went to giving rights to all religions in 1947 to now and you guys have not given rights to other religions apart from islam since 1947? I guess you are shia so as long as islam is official you wouldn't care would you? You only say ""this is wrong"" but no changes made. Then what's the point of whinning about hindutva?"
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"India has to there’s no other option. If India doesn’t want to come their best option is to get England,Aussie and New Zealand boards to also withdraw from the champions trophy as that would for pcb to move it to a 2nd country."
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,Lol just see this wiki page Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism - Wikipedia https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_state-sponsored_terrorism
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,I don’t think that’s true. BCCI can indeed refuse to play Champions Trophy 2024 on the basis of the Indian Government not giving BCCI permission to play in Pakistan. That’s is what is going to happen. Its something that hasn’t come up yet because of the World Cup. As soon as World Cup is over that’s what the next drama is going to be about.
comment,Ex Chairman of PCB Najam Sethi on PAKvsIND match,785,"Nice. Sharing a Wikipedia link 😂.

Read up on how India's agencies have been funding and also training terrorist organisations in Afghanistan to conduct terror attacks in Pakistan. Also, read up on Kulbushan yadav, a spy who India initially refused to acknowledge."

I don’t know if they plan to announce it in the next few days, but it’s seemingly unlikely to me. Would prefer Star Cricket to show it anyway, but no news from them either."

comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,Both SingTel and StarHub have confirmed that they will broadcast IPL 2020. YuppTV too has confirmed in their blogpost that they will stream excluding Singapore. So far no option view IPL 2020 in Singapore.
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"Hi everyone,

To confirm, StarHub will be screening it in the IPL League Games in Singapore under the new Indian+ Pack. Details can be found at [starhub.com/indianplus](http://starhub.com/indianplus)"
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,Seems like Singtel users have no option to watch IPL this year !! Anyone explored VPN options or buying StarHub plus on ur phone without the box (15SGD for basic subscription + 20SGD for Indian pack) ?
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,Hey so can you link the website and can I purchase the pack via starhub website or do I have to call them. I'm a singtel subscriber btw
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"Hi All, saw this thread. We can watch the IPL on Starhub Plus App for 15 dollars/months. So total cost would be 30 dollars for 2 months.

Basically, you have to be a new Starhub TV Subscriber. For existing customers, this would not apply and can only do thru the recontract option. So ask your family members who are not Starhub TV Customers yet. So do create an account for hub id. Then you can go ahead and subscribe. You have to choose a pack which is the Indian Plus for IPL. This option allows you to have a  trial without commitment for 2 months(60 days).  This should not be a problem as IPL schedule is within 2 months. After the IPL is over, do remember to cancel the the contract. You would not be charged extra for cancelling. Only 30 dollars for the 2months coverage.

If you do not cancel the contract before 60 days, you will be charged as per the contract agreement."

comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"Welp, updated post from a moderator says no  [https://community.starhub.com/conversations/channels-and-programmes/ipl-2020/5f551402a240381d8ced85f1](https://community.starhub.com/conversations/channels-and-programmes/ipl-2020/5f551402a240381d8ced85f1)"
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,Haha j work there so happy to provide more information. I believe it's an extra 20 bucks on top of the 15 for a monthly rate. All the best!
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,N keep looking! At least for existing starhub TV customers it is just impossible to subscribe. Yupptv was so much simpler. Just subscribe to an IPL package and you are done. Now its a maze of complicated pacakges and contracts. Total mess!
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"I think total gets to SGD65. 
30 for basic subscription (comes with entertainment plus pack). Plus 20 for no contract. 15 for Indian plus pack. 
I have still bought it. Just got a transaction confirmation message but still channel 238 in StarHub plus app is not available. Waiting since their site says processing takes some time."
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,You can visit Starhub Retail Shop to do it actually. The consultants on site will help you with your purchase.
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"I am not starhub customer, but looks like still can subscribe using Starhub TV+ pass and can watch using app or tvplus website.. 15+20 SGD without any contract..."
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,Only the first 56 out of 60 games will be broadcast? We have sign up for a new plan for 24months ?
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"I have wasted the last two hours of my life trying to understand what the hell Starhub is trying to tell me between 45 minute holds. I just want to sign up for the bare minimum without recontract to watch the IPL and I am getting all kinds of nonsense related to TVplus recontract/no contract, a website that barely works, having to add HBO at $13/mo. and other BS. Why does it have to be so hard for legal paying customers to just order a package to watch?"
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"EDIT: Received email with new agreement that lists Indian+ at $15/mo and topup for no contract at $20/mo. I am all set :) Updated original post with the relevant information.

Just got through to a salesperson on the phone. They have to add it manually to your existing hub account. $35/month with no contract (cancel anytime). I have been told it will be activated in one hour and a confirmation email will be sent to me in 10 minutes. Hopefully, no more phones calls that are !.5 hours +.

Note: StarhubTV+ (online only) is separate from Starhubgo (box + online). This subscription is for StarhubTV+ only."
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"I'm not familiar with the signing up etc. Do call 1633 for more info. From what i know there's a no contract plan too. Just need to top up.

W regards to the playoff games... stay tuned fro more info =]"
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"Really sorry man. Basically its 35 bucks for 1 month with no contract mayte. Its an app, you can cast it onto smart TV etc."
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"Hope its fine for you now..
I called 1630 and subscribed last friday..they will activate for you.. i am using chomecast to stream the starhub app in tv.. i am singtel customer but still can subscribe only for ipl"
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,damn. Singtel replied me yesterday saying they were still negotiating with STAR. They even brought in a new channel. Guess no IPL for me then this year.
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,So it’s 70 for 2 months right?
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,Hey can you tell me how to get the 35 bucks per month thing. Idm paying 35 bucks thanks
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"Mmm. I believe you don't have to be a StarHub subscriber to get access to StarHub TV+. Do call in 1633 for more info, I'm just sharing more info so yall know that there is indeed coverage in SG! =]"
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,Nope it requires me to subscribe to a 24 month contract. Damn. Singtel really is only for football fans.
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,"For StarHub there is 100% a no contract version! Call in at 1633. 

Not sure about Singtel."
comment,IPL 2020 livestream in Singapore,20,Thanks. Checked it out. Its $35 sgd per month. And paying $70 for 1.5 months of ipl is too expensive.

comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,"They have a really good coach. He was once upon a time best captain, before MS took his spot. But still the winning average between MS and pointing isn’t much."
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,2012 & 2009 nightmares still haunt me
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,"With the bowling relying heavily on two South African pacers, and Batting relying on Shreyas Iyer and Pant DC will need other players to perform if they have to win qualifiers. We saw Against SRH that DC can collapse against a strong Bowling line-up and Ashwin at 7 does not inspire confidence"
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,"Too early to say. They won 3 in a row, which they failed to do since 2017."
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,"RCB would have won against DC, only if RCB had restricted 190 or if they choose to bat first."
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,Ponting is a nice coach in ipl but I think mi knows his plan he captained mi in 2013 first half
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,"Nah, RCB should stick with Moin Ali. He's had just one match and can be a great finisher, Chris Morris will in fact be a great addition to RCB and if they can handle initial collapses they might qualify as well"
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,Honestly I don't think that's the case. It's just that MI was the best team in the tournament this year (which is mostly the case every year haha).
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,"Yep but rcb and dc have some kind of thing that the player they release does well against them qdk ,kl Rahul stoinis boult"
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,"I just don't get it why DC released a class player like Boult. It would have been great for DC if Boult would have played for them this year. Imagine Rabada, Nortje and Boult in one team. The best pace trio. And okay, they released Boult, but they gave Boult to MI. MI! You give one of the best pacer to the best team which is already overpowered. Fair enough."
comment,Strongest contenders of IPL 2020 with an extraordinary bowling lineup,219,They did that Because Boult wasn't in form and when they gave Boult bowling very less time in power play Because that is bowled by axar or ishant Sharma and Boults power is powerplay and tehy said him bowl in death how will he perform

comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,the fact Jofra Archer won the MVP with a ‘wooden spoon team’ in 2020 is commendable
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,Prior logo for teams had so much character. Now it's all minimalist so it would look good on merchandise.
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"2023 - SRH bottom of the table
2024 - SRH runner-ups 
Greatest transition🔥💯"
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,2016 2017 comments incoming bro 💀
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,the logo change from 2013 to 2014 hurt my soul
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"DD got 4 times last position everytime with different logo.

Delhi initially had a great team, They were there to win the 2009 until they messed up semifinal and BCCI brought in qualifiers

But seeing this the First Mega Auction in 2011 has messed up Delhi so much!"
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"In 2019, 4th placed SRH qualified with 12 points and last placed RCB had 11 points. 

In 2020, Jofra Archer of last placed RR won the MVP of the tournament."
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,Punjab. Table topper in 2014 and bottom of the table in 2015 and 2016. Perfectly balancing their consistency after that
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"Proud of us....Deccan Chargers/Sunrisers..... We've done that 3 times.....

I gues even PBKS and Delhi Daredevils have done that as well....."

Ps. Excluding the teams that played for less then 10 seasons"
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"Ok no shade on MI and CSK, both of them have earned the bragging rights. But are CSK fans really claiming to be better because they have played more finals? 

The number of trophies is the same. And it's not MI's fault that CSK weren't allowed to compete for 2 years. Those 2 years also wouldn't necessarily mean a trophy for CSK by default. Could have ended up like the 2022 or 2024 season as well."
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,Delhi with 4 diff logos.
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"proud to be fan of the team who performs worse than RCB and nobody really acknowledges our team, no fan base

DELHI 🤡🤡🤡"
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"MI fans getting rattled in the comments is so entertaining to watch especially this one account replying all csk fans😭😅 sit down kid csk has bashed u enough in knockouts and qualifying matches + csk has played more finals and qualified more times inspite of playing less seasons lol.

MI and KKR fans are more rattled bcz they didn’t see csk in this list than being rattled of them ending last in the tally😅"

Koi nehi, sarkar aur ""logo"" ko badalni chahiye bhi 😎👍🏻"
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,That year was very competitive I think it's the only year when 12 point got u the wooden spoon.
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,That year five teams were tied on points. 4to8 were based on nrr.
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"And we'll do the odd years of course!

And SRH and MI have always tried to help each other qualify. We helped you in 2021 by beating RCB (but didn't work out) and in 2023 by beating RR. You helped us in 2020 by playing a weak side in a must-win game and in 2019 by beating KKR."
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"It's actually worse. The problem with the current logos is that they aren't fully minimalist. To look good on merchandise such as hats-- for instance-- they should have the crest but NOT the words. When you look at a New York Yankees hat, it just has the NY... it doesn't also say New York Yankees on it."
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,The only other single digit teams are rr and kkr. Rcb not finishing bottom every season is no surprise considering how bad punjab or dd choke

This is our sick mentality to point out flaws in everything"
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,winning 5 in 15 seasons is bigger achivement than 0 in 17 or 5 in 17

comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"yeah agree with you, but csk has qualified for playoffs many times than MI(12 i think) and not only that, they have never been in bottom last of the table(except they didnt play for 2 years). This stats show that csk might seem slightly better."
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,Broo but I think reaching the finals or even qualifying is a grt thing we just saw how rcb celebrated on reaching to eliminator soo playing more finals can be used as a flex by csk fans
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"Csk now has 8 trophies damn
5 

+ 1 for playing more finals 😨😭

+ 1 qualifing more times 😰😭

+ 1 bashed u enough in knockouts 😱🥵"
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"Just saying

MI has higher head to head record against CSK in Chepauk and Wankhede and even neutral venues too. MI has also more wins in playoffs against CSK."
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,By a margin we didn't in 2022 only because mi sucked more than us. Also in 2020 there was a chance.
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,Only till 2020
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,i mean just think how lucky srh was to qualify for Playoffs in 2019 wirh 12 points

comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,choking is under pressure ie important matches knockouts/virtual knockouts etc. here they just used to play bad
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"CSK fans find a way to flex their 2 year hiatus from IPL😂😂

Winning 5 trophies in 6 finals, is still better than winning 5 in 10, plus you only won those finals bcoz you weren't facing MI, you literally got the last one thanks to Mohit Sharma's gratitude towards dhoni

Remember Bravo's words? ""I don't want MI in finals, I am scared of them""🤣"
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,">rcb celebrated on reaching to eliminator

And they have been trolled to no end for their antics. 

Say if CSk were to reach the finals unbeaten and then defeated by say any other team who lost 2 group stage games. Would they still be considered a better team? Because India got trolled for losses in the semis and finals for years now, mind you finished as table toppers at the end of the group stage in both the previous WC's. Don't see that being used as a flex by our supporters."

Expected this logic from a MI fan lol. Try adding more emojis to sound sarcastic next time. Good luck being rattled lol.

PS- Stop editing your reply after getting owned lol."

Back in 2011, we gave you a generational talent who played for 3 years for Hyderabad before returning home.

Now, please return the favor! Don't retain Tilak. Let him come home!"

comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,">Winning 5 trophies in 6 finals, is still better than winning 5 in 10

Skill issue, not csk's fault that MI weren't skilled enough on other 4 to even qualify"

Please ask other teams to decline CSK's payment please  /s

I dont understand why still other teams are taking money to lose 💀"

comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,Broo I am not saying that even of u loose in finals u r a better team ofc mi was better than csk during all finals but what I am making a point is making to final is also a achievement ofc the team that wins is the best but then there is a thing called runner-up and which can be and should be counted as achievement
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,"I am fun at parties, I edited my comment because of wrong formatting, forgot how to add next line, how old are you kid if just an edit above my comment gives you anxiety"

comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,The team which got defeated in finals is obviously better than than the team which didn't even qualify for playoffs

comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,sobs in ....2014 last match 🥺
comment,Wooden Spoon holders of every IPL season,609,Now I'm convinced. Go in deep into your shallow head. Firstly learn what bottling is. Reaching the final 3 times without winning is bottling. Failing to win the ipl after 16 years is choking(sorry RCB fans I had to) SA failing to win so many tournaments after coming so close is bottling and choking. Tottenham not winning anything big is choking. Please do get your facts straight and think about what you are saying before you comment. You don't want to come off as stupid like rn. If they choked at a big stage we would not have 5 trophies.

comment,IPL Points Table 2020,46,"Being an MI fan, we have seen how crucial the 2nd half has been for us.. So  in my opinion i would say that it's not advisable to write off any team at the moment. 

I could see CSK doing an MI this year. Dominating the 2nd half."

Hope you made preparations to delete your account cuz two out of your three predictions are in the bottom 3

comment,IPL Points Table 2020,46,Nope previous year srh with 6 wins 8 losses qualified for playoffs
comment,IPL Points Table 2020,46,"I want them to qualify too. After all, this might be the last chance for us to see Dhoni in action. 

The match against KXIP showed what they are capable of when they get going. I do believe there is some hope still, if Jadhav doesn't get to play another game, that is. 

They can either give Ruturaj a long rope at 2 or 3 and hope for him to come good (after all, they are in desperate need of some young blood), or if they feel he isn't cut out for this level they can simply add another bowler, say Chawla. They already have enough all rounders in the middle to do the job with the bat. One good game from the top order and its looking settled now. Similarly, the middle order needs just one good game and CSK can still turn it around."
comment,IPL Points Table 2020,46,"Yup, it happens when there is a frequent loss of matches by mainly (last) 4 teams"
comment,IPL Points Table 2020,46,"Cuz KKR faced like 5 defeats straight,if they had atleast 1 of their games they should have knocked SRH out"

comment,IPL Points Table 2020,46,"Yes exactly, the lineup is good, they just lose wickets and that creates a sudden increase in pressure. I hope they replace Jadhav with Rituraj. They need someone to support Faf, Watson and Rayudu out there, then I feel that would do the job. And also I'm worried about what will happen next year, if thala goes! Damn!"

comment,IPL Points Table 2020,46,"That is a different issue altogether. When Dhoni goes, CSK goes. Atleast the CSK we have known for 13 years goes. Almost an entirely new team might be seen. But there's a chance that Dhoni might play next season, considering that the big auction might not happen this year. Which would mean that CSK will have to effectively play with more or less the same squad. And I don't feel Dhoni will leave this squad for a season without him."

Virat never actually stressed and addressed about the lack of balance in the past seasons iirc... He was always talking about their bad luck...

comment,"IPL 2020: Virat Kohli should have got more involved if RCB squad lacked balance before, says Gautam Gambhir - cricket",66,I think it's because Kohli got more involved we don't have balance or talent. He always goes for flavor of the season.
comment,"IPL 2020: Virat Kohli should have got more involved if RCB squad lacked balance before, says Gautam Gambhir - cricket",66,"The problem with Kohli as captain is he doesnt know how to utilize bowlers resourcefully in shorter formats . When you dont have a great attack that is vital to win championships .One example being asking to bowl the likes of Umesh Watson  and Corey Anderson at the death.

That's something Dhoni was masterful at and Gambhir was really good as well .

Rohit doesnt have that issue because Mumbai  always have had great bowling attacks in IPL"

Then somehow Shankar, Pant and Rahul all came in the mix. It was a shit show. IMO 2 years ago it was evident he wasn't going to drop Dhoni, so giving him a run at 4 would have been perfect. I also think Rayudu would have been fine. They just panic all the time in selections."

comment,"IPL 2020: Virat Kohli should have got more involved if RCB squad lacked balance before, says Gautam Gambhir - cricket",66,"I think Kohli keeping his captaincy post also has to do with him finding great form after around 2015/16. Also, he hasn't seen much drop in his form neither has India been spectacularly bad. Indian management probaby doesn't want to upset best batsman in the team. If his form dips and India has few bad performances, there will be many more calls to get him out of captaincy. On his captaincy alone I think he has been subpar."

comment,"IPL 2020: Virat Kohli should have got more involved if RCB squad lacked balance before, says Gautam Gambhir - cricket",66,"That's true. I can name at least 10 players off the top of my head who did get many chances to play for the country, but were always on thin edge and were never secure of their place in the team, knowing that they could be replaced any time even after a single bad performance. Vijay in Test matches, Karthik when he got called up in England and Pant was sitting in the dugout for the first two test matches. If it were dhoni, he'd have ensured that the player got all 4 or 5 matches to play, so that they could feel secure and could concentrate on their game rather than their place in the team after that one or two matches.

Edit: *thin ice"

comment,Match Thread: 36th Match - Mumbai Indians v Kings XI Punjab,739,"MI has all the reason to be excited for super over. They'll bowl Bumrah and send Rohit, Pollard, Hardik to bat.

Punjab, doesn't have the same quality of bowler and Gayle wouldn't be that good against Bumrah, Maxwell is out of form and Rahul will have to do all the hitting.

Of course, this is Cricket and I may have to eat my words."

In case of Byju's I agree it's not a great product but they just became the 2nd most valuable startup in India and have boatload of money to spend.
